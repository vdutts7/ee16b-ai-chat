This week, we started Good morning class. Let's get started. So want to backup a little bit and talk about where we left off last lecture. Last lecture, we were looking at the solution of RC circuits with inputs. And in fact we solved general problem. Basically we said we have some arbitrary voltage source VS, right? And it's connected to an RC circuit. So if an R here and a C, and if you think about it, this is actually a fairly arbitrary circuit because we have powerful tools like Thevenin's theorem or Norton's theorem that could transform almost any circuit with a single capacitor into this equivalent circuit. So that's cool, but you might take, well, you just have one capacitor. Well, later on in this course, we'll see how you can take a circuit with multiple capacitors and analyze it. Each capacitor season equivalent circuit that just looks like this. That's what we're doing here is fairly general and it's good to spend some time to really understand the simplest case, especially if we can take more complicated cases and reduce them to this simpler case. So this simple case of just a simple input voltage source and RC is actually very important and we should spend some time on it. Now, as I mentioned last time, there's many ways to solve this problem. We solved it with this integral integrating factor method. And we got this general solution that also gives us the homogeneous solution. So we have the homogeneous solution here, and then we have this term which depends on the input. So this is the voltage source. And we're integrating the voltage source over time and we're multiplying it by something. And that's what we're going to talk about a little bit today. So using this solution, we did a sample problem. We took a step input. We assume that you have a voltage source connected to a switch. And we assume that initially the capacitor is discharged. And then at some time t equals zero, we close the switch. And once that switches closed, basically the general form of the solution becomes valid, right? So we can use that and substitute. And what we found was that the solution looks something like this. That the voltage, this is the voltage on the capacitor as a function of time. Remember the input is doing something like this. So this is VS, this is T effectively VS is zero up until time t is equal to zero. And then we close the switch. And so there's a VS being applied to the circuit. We can understand what's going on by saying that, okay, this capacitor C is initially not charged up. So the moment you close the switch, I'll just say this is 1 v. You've got 1 v here, you've got 0 v here. And so some current is gonna flow. Let's say this is a ten ohm resistor, right? So you're gonna get 100 milliamps of current flowing and charging up this capacitor, the output voltage. We would expect it to basically start rising. Remember we talked about the voltage across the capacitor is the integral of the current coming in. So if a constant current is coming in, than we would expect the voltage to ramp straight up linearly. But as the current constant. Current stock constant because the current is established by the difference between the input voltage, which is constant and the capacitor current voltage. So we could say that the current I in the circuit is basically VS, which is a constant minus Vc over r. Vs is 1 v at all time, but VC is evolving in time. It's a function of time. And as the voltage on the capacitor starts to increase, the current decreases. As the current decreases, the ramp rate slows down. So remember, if we look at the voltage across a capacitor and its relationship to the current. For a capacitor, we know the current is CDVDT. This just comes straight from Q is equal to CV. To take a derivative, we get I is equal to CDVDT. And so we can say that the integral, the voltage across the capacitor as the integral one over c of I of t, d t from some start time. And i'll, I'll call this x so we don't get confused between time and the dummy variable of integration. So if we started out at some initial time, t is equal to zero. The voltage on a capacitor is that initial voltage plus the integral of the current coming in. So if the current were constant, right, then this would just give us a linear ramp. Here we're saying, well, the current, initially, for very short timescale, it looks constant. So if you look on a very short timescale, it looks linear. But if you look at a longer timescale as vC starts to increase, then this slope necessarily has to decrease. So if we were to guess what the solution of the circuit is going to be, it should look something like this. As time goes on, the slope is decreasing, right? Because as time goes on, the capacitor charges up to a higher voltage, there's less current available to it. And so the final solution should, if we were to guess an educated guess, we would say, well, it should look something like this. And you might even guess that it'll never really get to 1 v, because by definition, when it gets to 1 v or zero current, right? And so this is always striving towards 1 v. The current is getting, as you get closer and closer to 1 v, the current is getting smaller and smaller. And so this slope is approaching zero, which means that if you wait long enough, you have to wait an infinite amount of time for this to completely charge up to 1 v. But of course we know it's an exponential function. And so within a few time constants, the characteristic time constant of the circuit tau is R times C. Within a few time constants, it gets very close to wait five or six time constants are at less than a percent away, 1 v. So this is the intuitive explanation for what's going on in this circuit. And this is more or less confirmed by this calculation that we did last lecture. Any questions? Yes. Yeah. So the question is clarify, homogeneous and particular solution. So the homogeneous solution, I mean, the definition is very easy. The homogeneous solution is the solution to this same circuit when there's no sources. So it's the solution to this circuit. Now physically, if you go in the lab and you find a resistor hooked up to a capacitor like this, right? You wouldn't expect anything exciting to be happening, right? Because if this capacitor replaced in a drawer with a resistor connected to it in parallel. Even a few minutes ago, right? Unless it's a very large capacitor where the RC time constant is large, is discharged to zero. So if you say, well, what's the solution of this circuit? When? There are 0 v across the capacitor. In other words, Q is equal to zero. The solution is very simple. Zero, nothing's happening. On the other hand, if someone hands you a capacitor with a resistor hooked up to it and they say, I just charge it up to 10 v. Then we would solve this problem. And the homogeneous solution would be v of zero e to the minus t over Tau, where Tau is the RC time constant of the circuit. In other words, the capacitor would discharge from 10 v down to 0 v, right? If you wait infinitely long with a characteristic time constant Tau, That's the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution only depends on the initial conditions. If the initial conditions are zero, the homogeneous solution is zero. Now the particular solution is the solution of putting a voltage source here. This voltage source we call the VS can be anything. It could be like a step function that we just looked at zero up until some time, then it could pop up to a value. It could be a sinusoid. It could be your voice, right? It could be a recording of your voice. In other words, the variations in air pressure as you ask your question. So here, when we solve this equation, it's giving us the total solution. It's telling you that look, if you set V of S equal to zero, this term goes away and you're just end up with this homogeneous solution to find k. In that case, we would apply the initial conditions in the general case. In order to find k, we have to actually set this whole thing equal to the initial condition. Let's say at time t is equals zero, it's 10 v. Well, you also have to take into account what the voltage source is doing at time t equals zero. That's something actually that came up in office hours. You know, someone was solving this problem, a problem on the homework and they're using something similar to this. And they were setting K based on just the initial conditions. But that's not the case. The total solution we have to set K equal to the new. We have to basically set this whole total solution equal to what initial value it is. So good hint when you're solving these kinds of problems is, remind yourself that this is a physical problem. It's not a math problem, right? So you know what should be happening at certain times. You need to be given some initial condition. Verify that your solution satisfies the initial condition, right? If it doesn't, you've made a mistake. Also, you know what happens if you wait really long? Long enough. If you wait long enough, then the circuit is essentially a DC circuit. So if I wanted to know what's the solution, if I wait a really long time, if you wait a very long time, then basically if I just looked at this circuit and I didn't know anything about it. And the input we're constant like we were talking about earlier. If this is the circuit, if I wait a very long time, intuition tells me that this capacitor gets charged to the same voltage as V S. Right? So use those and those kinds of intuition and use your physical intuition to try to verify that the solution is correct. Okay, so I just want to introduce the terminology here, which is step responses. Step response. Sometimes called u of t, is what's the response of the circuit for an input? For this input. And what is u of t? U of t is simply a function that is zero. Up until t is equal to zero, then it goes to 1 v. So if we hook, if we actually look at our circuit, you might say, well that's kind of what we just solved. Because what we solved was we had a battery, we disconnected it. And then at time t is equal to zero, we connected it. And we basically had to know something about this capacitor. At time t is equal to zero, we have to know the initial value of this voltage. Now with a step input, there is no switch. The voltage is switching. So good example of this could be, you know, this is a digital pin of the Arduino and the lab. And at time t is equal to zero, you decide to move the voltage from 0 v to 1 v. It's an IO pin. In that case. I don't need to tell you what the initial voltage on the capacitor is, right? Because before time equals zero, the input voltage was zero. And it's been held zero for a very, very long time. So even if ten years ago somebody charged up that capacitor, right? It's been discharging for ten years, right? So it's basically at 0 v. In other words, at time t is equal to zero, we have, the assumption is we've waited a very, very long time. We've been holding this voltage here at 0 v. And so this capacitor is also at 0 v. And then at time t is equal to zero, the voltage abruptly changes from 0 v to let say 1 v. How do we solve this problem? Well, it is exactly, the solution is exactly the same as what we just solved for this case of the switch. Because the initial conditions are the same. The voltage is initially at 0 v, and after 0 v, basically it's the same circuit. So we know how to solve this problem. We know that the solution is going to look something like this. The characteristic time RC, same exact solution. The next thing I want to introduce is the idea of solving the circuit with assort with basically two different sources. So we know how to solve the problem for a source. That's just a step function. What if I want to, but if I want to solve this problem for a pulse input, again, this is a very practical situation. Because again, I can imagine a digital IO pin that goes one For what? For a milliseconds and then goes back down to zero. And I want to understand what happens. This is kind of a pulse response. What happens to the circuit? Well, this step response is very convenient because if you think about it, a pulse response, let me draw a pulse response. Let's say this is a pulse. It has some duration T. This is time. We'll call this p of t. And we'll call this u of t. What almost looks the same as u of t. So let me draw u of t here. U of t also a zero up until time t is equal to zero. But then u of t stays at one. So how can I get a pulse out of a step? Well, if I delay this step and invert it and subtract it out from this step. In other words, if I make, I can basically say p of t is u of t minus u of t. Delayed. Write minus sign to cancel it out. U of t is zero up until the delay time. So we get a nice pulse here. And then after the delay time. So I should really delay it by t seconds. After delaying it by T, then I get a one minus one. They subtract out, it goes to zero, it gives me the pulse response. So how do I delay u of t by t? Well, I just subtract out t from the argument. So now at time zero, this is u of minus t. U of minus t is still zero. You have to go to time t is equal to capital T to reach the argument of zero, in which case this will pop up. So this is a delayed step function. Okay? Now the question is, can I solve, can I use my solution from the step input to solve the pulse input function? In other words, I have this differential equation here. I'm going to say the input is a pulse function. And let me just go back and copy this differential equation. Just write it down. It's fine. So remember our differential equation look like this. There was a constant term plus the derivative term where tau is equal to RC. Now I'm going to, I'm interested in the particular solution of this equation. I'm going to say, well look, the pulse can be written as two functions. So is it possible to break up VC into two solutions? So let me write it as follows. F to be careful not to abuse notation because someone will pop up and say, Well, what's going on are these primes? And so let me not call these primes because someone's going to think these are derivatives. And so I'll call this solution one and this is solution to. So basically the first solution takes care. So if I expand this out, this I'm claiming is the solution to a pulse. This is the solution to u of t. The second term, I'm saying is a solution to the second pulse. Now in this case, this is a pulse, but there can be two inputs. So the idea is I know the particular solution for two different inputs. This is input number one. I can solve this equation. We know how to do that. This is input number two. I can solve this equation. I already know how to do that. And notice that by linearity, if I were to sum these two equations, I get my first equation. In other words, you can take your source and break it up into components, solve the problem for each component separately, and then put them back together. So it's like a superposition problem, except a superposition of the same source. We're simplifying the source into two component parts. And since the equations are linear, I can always do that. The solution is just going to be the sum of the two individual solutions. So, does that make sense to everybody? So now, if I think about what the second solution is going to look like. So I'm thinking of my circuit as kind of a system that takes a step function u of t. And the output does this. This is V of t, the capacitor output voltage. Now, if I take the same system, this is my system. This is what my system is inside, what it looks like. But for now, just imagine it's a black box. If I take this same circuit and I hook up the same input but just delayed. What should the output be? Intuition, your physical intuition, what does it tell you? Okay, Lots of hands are going up. There's some intuition. Same output just delayed. Okay, why did we, why did I, Can we come to that conclusion? You're making some kind of implicit assumption about the system. What are you assuming about the system? Well, simply put, it's so simple, you're not saying it because it's so obvious. You're assuming that, that capacitor doesn't have a clock inside of it and the resistor doesn't have a clock inside of it. In other words, the capacitor and the resistor. Don't care what time it is. They do the same thing no matter what, right? If I take a capacitor and a resistor and I hook them up to voltage source today and measure their output response. And then I come back tomorrow, do the same experiment. If I get a different result, what could you say about the capacitor and resistor? They must have changed. They care about what time of day it is. But if we assume that the capacitor and the resistor are time invariant, That's the technical term, time-invariant. They don't care about what time it is, then the response should be the same. Right? And of course, the response is delayed, right? If the input signal is delayed, you should get the same response delayed. So that means that if I were to take this output, I just need to delay it to get the new output. So this is the old output. Me draw it in. So this is a delayed copy. Delayed by T. We delayed the input by t. The output gets delayed by T. So that means that if I were to put a pulse into my system, I know what the pulse responses if I put in u of t, the output is one minus e to the minus t over Tau VS. Right? That's my pulse risk. This is my step response. Now I'm putting in u of t minus capital T. What's the output going to be exactly the same, just delayed. Now I have to make sure that I qualify this. This solution is only valid if you're looking at positive time. Because if you look at negative time, what's the output? Zero? Because the capacitor is discharged. Similarly over here, I have to qualify and say this is only valid if t is greater than capital T. If T is less than capital T, the output is zero. The capacitor is discharged. Okay? So I have a piecewise solution. I know what happens at time greater than t, I know what happens at time less than t. And so now to get the pulse response, all I need to do is put a little minus sign here. That puts a minus sign here. And then I say p of t by kind of source superposition is u of t minus u of t minus Tau. And the straw that what that's gonna look like. So I'm putting a pulse into my system and I want to know the output. And I know that the first step is going to produce this output. This is u of t. Then after some delay time, I'm going to get a second step. It's going to go negative. This is u of, this is not u of t, This is V of t, excuse me. This is a V of t minus tau. So this is the delayed. And we know that it's zero before that. And so if I sum these two curves together, you can see that I'm going to follow zero up until time t is equal to zero. Let me use a different color, a little bit. Green. So that's gonna be zero up until time t is equal to zero, then it's going to, it's going to basically give us the step response of the first. But then at time t is equal to T, both are active. And so this, this one is going to start pulling this whole thing down. And eventually this goes to one times V s. So let me just say it goes to the S. Well, I said it's a step response, so step is a unit quantity, so we'll just say it goes to one. This goes to asymptotically to minus one. So asymptotically the total pulse response goes to zero. Okay? So the total response here for input pulse is this kinda smeared out pulse. How much smearing do you get? Well, I've kinda made an assumption here that the time constant of the circuit tau is less than t. Right? And you can see that if, if tower very small, small RC time constant, then the output pulse would look very much like the input pulse. If you make tau really large, then actually you barely get any output at all. So what do I mean? So let's look at that. Let's look at two cases. This is R1, C1, and this is R2, C2. So we have two time constants. Both of them we're going to excite with a step voltage. Let's say, let's do a pulse response, not a step response. For this is a p of t. It's the same pulse applied to both circuits. And let's say T is equal to one millisecond. And let's say R1 times c1 is 0.1 millisecond. So we'll call this tau one. And then for this circuit, tau two, we'll say R2, C2 is ten milliseconds. So we've kinda could think of the first circuit is very fast. It has a small time constant. You can charge and discharge very quickly, right? Remember the homogeneous response tells us how fast the circuit charge and discharge when you apply an input. Even though Well, let me not confuse you guys. So let me just draw out you can, I don't even need to use equations. I can just use intuition to say, okay, for the circuit one, I have a pulse coming in. And I know that the pulse response is extremely fast. It's about one-tenth of t. This is t. So very quickly within one tenth of the time, it's already reached 67% of 1 v, right? And over here, once this goes down, this is going to start decreasing. Follows the input again within a time constant of tau. This is tau one. It response. So the input pulse and the output pulse kinda look the same. The only difference is that there's a slope, right? There's an exponential slope associated with this. It's a non-zero slope. What about that slow circuit? Let's now draw tau two. So this is tau one. This is the fast circuit. I guess it's probably good to put this into a little bit of historical perspective. Historically, one of my favorite examples of technology changing the world was the first transatlantic cable, when people for the first time could communicate from Europe all the way to the US because they put a cable under the sea, right? It's really interesting story of how they got the cable all the way. Imagine like taking a cable from New York all the way to the closest point somewhere north of England. So imagine taking this huge long cable, thousands of miles long. Railing it, putting on a ship. Fact what they decided to do was take two cables and connect them together in the middle at two ships going from one place to another. But just take a moment to think about how that change history. So before that point, if something happened in Europe, stock market crashed, people in the US would be happily unaware of what's going on. A war breaks out in Europe, right? It takes basically a few days to actually get the information to the US because you have to take a ship, write a letter, Hey, there's a war in Europe, we need your help right? Week later, people in the US feet figure out, Oh, there's a war going on. Once this cable was operational, this transatlantic cable, you could communicate instantaneously, right? Nearly inspect the speed of light. You sent a telegram, Hey, there's a war out here. So telegrams work with pulses. You send it basically the first communications that we had were digital communications. People didn't realize they could actually put analog signals on this until later. So they were putting pulses, dots and dashes, right? Little beeps. And basically they had two symbols of 0.1. And the telegraph operator would type away zeros and ones. And the zeros and ones would travel on cables and reach the other side. So the zeros and ones or pulses, right? And we're looking at the pulse response of an RC circuit. Well, if you think about that really long cable, you realize that there's a problem. It's a really long cable, right? Of two wires here. Here's our, this is our telegraph operators sending pulses. What do you think the pulse has looked like when they first turn the circuit on? Didn't work. In fact, you can understand why it didn't work even without going into the details. But you know that this thing is a really long resist. You know, basically it's a really long wire. No matter how good of a wire it is, how thick it is, it has resistance. And so this circuit has a resistance associated with it, Right? Also, you've got two wires next to each other. No matter how far apart your put them. There's capacitance between them, right? And so we know the two conductors next to each other have capacitance. So really this is an RC circuit. Actually happens to be a distributed RC circuit because of the capacitance and resistance are kind of intertwined. But if we just think of it in a very simple way as an RC circuit, we can see that if the RC time constant is too big, it's going to be hard to communicate fast. So if you're sending pulses, let's say that telegraph operator can type 100 times, can do 100 symbols per second. How does that compare with the time constant of this circuit? If the time constant of the circuit is longer than 100, 100th of a second, then those pulses are gonna get smeared out. So let's look at the situation where the time constant Tau, tau two, it is very big. So that means that our first step comes in. And this circuit is just really slow, right? It's just taking its time. Rising up. Then the second pulse step arrives over here, right, to produce our step function. And this drops. Now in this case, I didn't even satisfy this, right? I made this roughly equal in this graph. So instead of getting this nice pulse output, we get this many pulse looking thing, right? In fact, you can see that the amplitude has been reduced substantially, right? If I, if I actually truly go to this limit, then it's gonna look something like this. It's going to just barely get up to here. And then it's going to barely come down. So you're gonna get this little runt of a pulse, right? Very, very tiny short pulse is going to come out. And you can see that the bigger the time constant of the circuit, the smaller the output. So this is a property of this RC circuit. It's actually a very important property. And so it will distort. We can see in general that RC pulses will distort. Rc circuits will distort dork pulses unless you make their time constant is very fast. And this is why in the world of electronics, we're obsessed with miniaturisation. What does miniaturisation do? We build transistors and we make them smaller? Why are we making them smaller? Well, smaller is better, right? Because you can fit more. But also we can go faster. We can run our circuits faster. The fast, the fastest we can run the circuits depends on the capacitances between the wires. And the capacitance is formed by the transistors. The smaller we make the transistors, the smaller those parasitics. Now. I'll explain more of that later in today's lecture. So hold onto that idea. Okay, the next thing I wanna do is actually think about this system. I want to look at this particular solution and show, sorry, I'm going all the way back here. I want to show that we can reformulate this in a really interesting way. So what I wanna do is I want to take this part of it. So this is the forced solution. This is the particular solution or the force solution. And it's kind of difficult to figure out what's going on here because we're, we're integrating this input. This is the input. We're integrating it, but we're multiplying it by this term. E to the st. Remember S is equal to one over tau. So I can just put that in here. Then we multiply it by another exponential factor. So let me just move this exponential inside and see what happens. Now, keep in mind that this is an integration. The dummy variable of integration is x, right? You can change x to anything, right? I remember when I was an undergrad, somebody did this and it kind of helped me understand what's going on. They said this is a Smiley face. And it's still the same integral, right? That's a dummy variable of integration. It doesn't matter what it is. Call it the x. It could be called y. Let's just be careful and not call it t, because we call it t. We might get confused between two variables which have the same name because there's a T for sure. That's time. That's the current, the solution, we're saying is the solution at current time t is an integral from minus infinity to t of this quantity inside. And this quantity inside is a function of this dummy variable. Happy face. Okay? So I called the happy face x. It's probably easier to draw an x and a happy face. What I'm going to do is I'm going to move this inside the integral. I can do that because as far as the integral is concerned, this is just a constant, right? Because this t is not the same as x. So let me move that inside. And of course, the defining property of exponentials is that when you multiply them, their arguments. So this gives us x minus t over Tau v of x dx. And just to get more intuition for what this is, I'm going to just rearrange it. I'm going to define a new variable y. My present. Why would you do that? But we'll see in a minute. Notice that inside this integral y prime, let's call it d y is minus dx. So if I rewrite this in terms of y, this becomes x minus t becomes minus y. So this is minus y over tau. And x is equal to T minus y. Dx is minus d y. And of course this becomes positive infinity. And this becomes at t is equal to x, this becomes zero. And I can get rid of this minus sign by just flipping the integral around. By the way, if I make a mistake here, catch me and correct it. But I can now see that I have the solution in a form that I kinda like. I call it the moving average. Okay? So as far as the particular solution is concerned, we've recast it in this following form, which is telling me that this RC circuit has history obviously, why do I know it has history? Because the output depends on the past values of the input. So what is this quantity, right? This is our input. V of t. Of course V S of t is the current value of the input. V S of t minus anything is a past value of the input. So this is past values of the input. This is the input source. Past value, right? How far back in time is it going? It's going why seconds back in time? There was a question. If you just basically, we're changing our limits of integration, right? We're making this change of variable. And so if I plug in t here, right? T minus t is zero. So if you look at this integral, notice that I'm taking t minus y. Now I'm integrating y from zero to infinity. So when y is equal to zero, this is just the current value of the input. And then as y becomes increasingly more positive, we're looking further and further into the past values of our input function. So we're saying that the output is an integral, integration of the past values of the input. But it's not just a normal integration. It's actually some kind of weighted integration. It's kinda like a weighted average. I didn't get it. I think I should call this a weighted average, not a moving average. I think there was a question over here. Yeah. How did you move it? It's just a constant, right? This is basically this integration is over x. This is a function of t. So this is a perfectly valid way of looking at things, but it's a little bit complicated because it involves two things being multiplied by each other and there's two exponentials involved. So I'd like to just put these exponentials together. And now this integral is telling me that look, the capacitor output voltage is a weighted sum of the input signal. And what is that weighted sum is weighing past values of the input signal. What's the weighing factor, right? The weighing factor is this exponential. This exponential is characteristic of the circuit because it has a towel in it. So this is, this is the weight. Let me draw this in another way. Let me create a blank slate here. So notice that one over tau is the time that we're using in our weight, weighting function. So let's say this is our input. This is V S of t. And we're interested in knowing what's the output of our circuit at some time T prime. Well, this integral is saying that to figure out what the output is here, what we take is we take an exponential function. This is e to the minus y over Tau. And we multiply the input. This is our input. We multiply these two things together. And we integrate over this time. Of course, we're integrating from minus infinity to here. But you can see that the, what's going to contribute the most to this integral is more or less a few towels. So if we go back a few time constant Tau and we take an N, we're averaging over that time tau, right? There's a one over tau here, that's the averaging process. So our circuit is kinda like an averaging circuit, except it's not just averaging the past, It's really favoring the recent past. So the past tau seconds are the most important. If you go back five or six towels, circuit doesn't care, right? Because the exponential is really small. And so those terms are not going to contribute significantly to the integral. So if you think about this integral, it's the first few time constants in the past that matter. So our RC circuit, another way to see its behavior is to say that it likes to average the past. Okay? Why does it do that? Why does it average exponentially? There's actually a really good reason for that. Maybe it's a little bit of a detour, but I'll give you guys a hint. This exponential here, it looks a lot like what, what solution does this look like? Looks like the homogeneous solution, right? We know the homogeneous solution looks like this. It just decays exponentially. So what this is saying is a past values are decaying exponentially, but they're contributing to the current input. So every time the input function via address changes, the system responds with its characteristic response, which is the homogeneous solution. Okay? So if we think of our signal input as being a bunch of tiny disturbances, every disturbance excites one of these characteristic responses are natural responses. So the output at any given time is a sum of all those previous natural responses. Okay? Okay, if that doesn't make sense, don't worry, it will eventually. But for now, we have a really interesting interpretation which allows us to understand this circuit at a different level. So for instance, because the fact that this circuit does averaging, Let's imagine we excite it with an input that does something like that. You might think, well, what is this? This could be again, an opera singer right there going. You know, that there's a high-frequency part where the vibrations are going up much faster, right? So the function, if you think about it, if you pass it through a low-pass filter, let's say that tau is about this big. And so if I wanted to guess what the output is going to look like, I'm going to say, well, you know what? It's gonna kinda track the input up until this point, because the input is not really changing too much on the timescale of tau, right? It's more or less constant, it's varying, it can track it. What about here? Well, here it's going up and down, up and down, up and down. And when I average this, I'm kinda, kinda just maybe go up and down a little bit. But I'm going to more or less ignore this part. So this circuit, we call it a low-pass filter. Low-pass, low frequencies pass, right? Slow paths. In other words, if the signal changes slowly, it passes that capacitor there is storing information, right? And if we want to pass information faster, then that time constant of the circuit, the circuit won't respond. And so the averaging effect means it's not going to respond to this variation. Now this way of looking at the circuit is very different. And we're going to come back and look at this later in the course. But if this is your first introduction of how this thing works from a time domain perspective. Later on we're gonna give a frequency domain perspective. And it's gonna be a lot easier to understand what's going on, but it's all here. The other thing that's really interesting about this circuit is what if we switch the role of the capacitor and the resistor? Now, the same exact differential equation is still valid, right? Putting changing the order of these components didn't change anything. The current in the circuit is the same. Kvl is the same. So everything we solved is the same. This is the same circuit. Changing the order of series elements doesn't change any of the equations. Changing the order of parallel elements doesn't change anything. So it's really the same circuit, same solution. So we know what VC is. We have a solution for it, right? We know that it's this basically e to the minus y over Tau VS of T minus y d y. This is the particular solution. But we're interested in the output across the resistor, not the capacitor. So we want to know what VR is. Well, remember, VR resistors have no memory. Their output is just going to follow very faithfully whatever happens around them. In this case, we have a voltage source. We can say that the voltage drop across this resistor VR is simply the S minus Vc. Okay? Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Somebody who's awake. Okay. So this is the output across the resistor is the same as the source. It follows the source Exactly In step, except the capacitor comes in and subtracts out whatever value it's holding. Okay, so how can we, can we use the same kind of thinking to understand what's happening in this circuit. Let's go back to our example that we gave earlier. Again, we have signal that slowly varying and then it goes fast, and then it goes slow again. So this, again, we're going to assume that tau is roughly this time scale. So if you think about this circuit, it's basically subtracting out the average. So VS minus. The weighted average. So over here, the signal is changing very slowly. So every time I take an average of it, right, I'm multiplying through averaging over this time interval. It's not changing substantially. So if I were to imagine the response of this circuit, just very intuitively, I would say, well, the output is going to be pretty small. It'll track. But with much attenuation because we're always subtracting out the average of the signal. I'll come back to your question. Over here though. We can see the average is changing on a very fast timescale, much faster time scale than this circuit. So i'm, I'm gonna guess again, I'm just guessing here. Just intuition that I'm going to be able to track that input. Because on this time scale, the input changes rapidly and the output is going to follow. Again. The signal goes constant. Once it goes to constant, when I subtract out the average, it goes away again. And so we can say that this circuit, if we look at the output across the resistor, we might be tempted to call this a fast pass circuit, and let's fast signals past. Well, we call those high-frequency signals. Those are hot. So this, we call this a high-pass filter. I think there was a question that popped up. Yeah. So here if we do a KVL write V S is equal to VC plus VR, right? So I'm saying VR is VS minus VC. Okay? Now I want to give you one more final example that's very interesting. Which is, what is the response of this circuit if you just put in a sinusoid, okay? Now a sinusoidal signal. Some of you are familiar with sinusoidal signals, some of you are not. Most of you have seen sinusoidal signals. Sinusoidal signal does something like this. This signal is very important. And the reason is that Fourier analysis allows us to decompose any arbitrary signal to a bunch of sinusoids, right? Think about your voice. Every time you say a vowel, you're, you're actually emitting a sinusoid plus some of the harmonics of that sinusoid. Every time you make a non vowel sound like. That's a noisy signal. You're just pushing out noise, which happens to be a lot of frequencies which are not integer related to each other. It's not what I wanted. Know. Sinusoidal response is really important. And what we're going to find out is that these kinds of circuits have a very interesting response to sinusoids. Now, we could analyze this circuit with a sinusoid, right? We can take that integral and just plug in VS is equal to a, Let's say sine of omega t. And do all the math. But it actually turns out much easier to do the math for a complex exponential. Complex exponential. And some of you need to review or even learn some of these concepts. Constant, constant, exponential, if we just plug in an imaginary argument, just spins around the circle. And we know that the sine and cosine are basically the real and imaginary parts. So if we were to follow the real part, if we project this vector, which is just a unit, unit vector going around the circle, the x-component is the cosine of omega t and the y component is sine Omega t. And of course, I shouldn't say, of course if you've seen this before, you know that this is just Euler's identity. How many people are comfortable with complex exponentials? Good. Maybe a third of you, so many of you need to review and learn this material. So this complex exponential is just spinning around the circle. And the rate at which it spins around is determined by this function, by, excuse me, by this argument omega, which we call the frequency. So for instance, if we write Omega as two pi f. That means that if F is equal to one, this goes to pi radians. So this is spinning around at a rate of one time per second. If you make, this goes around the circle ten times a second. For those of you who've never seen complex exponentials, this is going to be a little bit weird. But trust me, when you learn complex exponentials, you can come back and look at these slides and they'll make perfect sense. So I apologize for prefetching for those people who maybe are not familiar. Okay, So what we wanna do is we want to use this general solution again and plug in a complex exponential. So we're looking at the, basically we're looking at the sinusoidal steady-state. In other words, I'm not interested in what happens on a short timescale after I apply the sine wave. I'm interested if I wait a very long time, What's the response of the circuit going to be? We call that the steady-state response. So this is the general response. This is always valid, right? For this circuit, if I'm interested in the steady-state response, this integral, this kind of weighted average is always valid. And so I'm going to plug in, I want to know what is, what if I plug in some frequency omega t into this system? There's a one over tau missing here. So this is e to the minus y over Tau times e to the j omega t minus y d y. Well, I have two exponentials. I just multiply them together. That's nice. I'm going to get e to the j omega t minus y minus basically just these two things added together. So y over t tau plus j Omega t minus y. And basically this term here, it just has a J term and then it has a y term. So let me just call this little bit. Something's missing here. Let me just make sure this is correct. I guess it's right. So when I do this integral, integral of a complex exponential is another complication when she got to catch a mistake. That JWT. Thank you. That's the mistake. Yeah. I knew it didn't look right. So this is j omega t minus j omega y minus y over Tau. So here this becomes just integrating. So let me just make my life easier. I'm just integrating over y. So I'll just pull out this complex exponential. And then I have e to the minus j omega plus one over tau y DY. So when I, when I integrate this, I just get the one over tau, of course comes out. I get the same thing. Evaluated from zero to infinity divided by j Omega plus one over tau. Now, if I plug in infinity, not infinity. So when I basically, I'm kinda screwing this up a little bit, but bear with me. When I do this integration, I'm integrating over y from y is equal to zero to infinity. If we assume the infinity part goes away because this is a real part and its positive tau is always positive. So e to the minus. Real part, which is very, very large as almost zero, that part goes away. So the infinity part goes away and we're just left with the zero part. So when I plug in y is equal to zero, this just becomes one. And the denominator looks like this. And so I can write this as e to the j omega t 1/1 plus J Omega tau. That's the solution. That's the solution when you apply a sinusoidal input, this case a complex exponential into our circuit. I'll get your question in a second. But what is this? What can you say about the solution? The interesting observation. Well, it has two parts. It has this part, right? What is this part? Same as the input. It's just a complex exponential. What's this part? It's a constant, right? Omega is the frequency that we put in. Tau is the characteristic time constant of the circuit. This whole thing is just a constant. It's a complex constant. So it has, you can think of it as a real plus imaginary, or you can think of it as magnitude plus phase. So the magnitude tells you what the output amplitude is going to be. If you put an a sinusoid, the output amplitude is going to be different. It's going to be less than one. You can see this equation, 1/1 plus J Omega tau, if you take the magnitude is always less than one. So the sinusoid gets attenuated. And it's going to have some phase response, right? So the phase of the output is not going to be the same as the phase of the input and steady-state. There's gonna be a phase shift. In other words, the complex exponential is going around the circle on the input. The output is also going around the circle has radius is going to be smaller and it's going to be delayed. So let's draw that. So here's our input. Has, let's say a unit amplitude. And what we're saying is the output is some delayed copy. And so the magnitude, I'll call this magnitude h e to the j omega t plus the argument of h, where I'm just calling this whole thing h. H is just a complex number. And so both of these circles, but both of these arrows are going around the circle at the same speed. Except the output. The smaller one is the output. It has less amplitude and it's delayed. I'll get back to your question after we first address the question earlier question over here. You still have your question. Yeah. Well, they don't allow slow signals because they're canceling out the average signal. The capacitor is able to charge up to the average value of the voltage coming in. And we're subtracting that out. If you're a signal that changes slowly on a timescale of tau, then the capacitor is always going to charge up to the same voltage and you're going to subtract it out because the resistor is the voltage at the input minus the voltage on the capacitor. Okay, Question in the back. In the back first. Still have your question. Okay. Maybe in the middle here. Yeah. On the previous slide. Minus on the right-hand side because yeah, it should be minus, but let's not worry about that. There's some Simon sign error somewhere here. Yeah, But good point. So why isn't there a minus sign here? Because when you solve the integral over the zero separately, okay? So the two mistakes canceled out very nicely. Thank you. Alright. Now that this is actually a really important result, there is a way of interpreting this result, which is basically we can take this response. We found that h, Basically we put an e to the j omega t. We went into our low-pass filter, right? I say it's a low-pass filter because we're looking at the output of the capacitor. And what we got out was e to the j omega t times H of j omega, where H of j Omega is just a complex number. We can write that as magnitude H of j Omega and then a face of h. In other words, if you put in a sinusoidal input, the output is also sinusoid. Its amplitude could get shifted and its phase can get shifted. So if I could characterize how the amplitude response of this circuit looks, let me look. Plot H of j Omega. Magnitude versus frequency H of j Omega is simply 1/1 plus J Omega tau. So if omega is very, very small, That's very low frequencies. This term is one. If omega is zero, this is just zero. Basically the whole thing is, this is zero. And so this whole thing is just one. If I get to a frequency of one over tau, then that J term becomes one, j Omega tau becomes one. And this whole thing drops by a magnitude of one over square root of two. So this decreases. It hits a magnitude of one over square root of two at this frequency. Omega equals one over tau. And then it continues to drop as you get to higher and higher values. Eventually, this just looks like one over j Omega tau, so it's just decreasing, right? So this is telling you that the magnitude of the output sinusoid at low frequencies is more or less the same as the input. But as you get to higher and higher frequencies, the output amplitude is dropping like one over omega. Okay? So this is why we call it a low-pass circuit is at low frequencies. Or down here, they pass, right? You can kinda say that mostly anything up to here passes with the edge case, passing with magnitude one over square root of two. If we square that, we get one-half. Squaring is basically power. So we can say from a power transfer characteristic up to a frequency of one over tau, half the power can pass. Okay, There's a question in the back. Yeah, What's the physical significance of complex exponential? Yeah, it's a good question. So complex exponential, There's two ways of looking at it. So basically we know from Euler's theorem that this is true. If I look at a complex exponential now spinning in the opposite direction. Cosine is an even function, nothing happens. Sine is an odd function. So I get this. So if I sum these two things together, I get two times cosine omega t. Now this is definitely for those of you who haven't looked at complex numbers in awhile, you'll need to do some reviewing here to get this stuff. There's going to be discussion sections and all that. But the important point is that I can get my sinusoidal response, which is very physical, right? From looking at the response of two complex exponentials, one spinning one way and another one's spinning the other way. And the reason why I prefer to use complex exponentials over sines and cosines is it's just a lot messier with sines and cosines. I have to use my trig sum of angles, formulas and equations, start filling up pages with constant. With complex exponentials. Everything is simple. Complex exponentials are very nice. They're very simple. In fact, if you had to give this complex exponential and name, what would you name it? Okay. Phasor. No, let's not call it a phasor. What would you call it with respect to you guys? From 16 a. Think about your 16. Think of this as a system, right? What we're saying here is this function when it goes into the system at, pops out unchanged except for its magnitude and phase. The functional form doesn't change, right? Yeah, It's like an eigenvalue, like it's some kind of eigenfunction, right? We haven't stated eigenfunctions. But we know in linear systems there are certain vectors. If you put a certain vector which is an eigenvector into its linear system, it pops out, multiply it by an eigenvalue. So what would you call h? If, if this is an eigenfunction? What's h? Eigenvalue? It's a complex eigenvalue. Okay? So this is, I very carefully here put the word preview just so I wouldn't scare the ones who are still are not comfortable with this material. This is a preview of what we're gonna do later, but it's really cool because it just comes out of this very simple analysis. I wanted to just also explain why this happens. Why does, why is it physically that this is an eigenfunction of this particular differential equation. It turns out later on, we'll show that it's an eigenfunction of any linear ordinary differential equation. In other words, any kind of FCR circuit that you can build with linear components. These complex exponential is going to pop back and say, yep, worthy eigenfunctions. Why is that? Thinking about this, if I want to think of this poetically, I would say, well, the complex exponentials, the circle. It traces a circle and a circle. It's kind of like a perfect shape in a non distorted world, right? A circle always as a circle, no matter what. It doesn't matter where you are on a circle, it always looks the same. That's actually the essence of why they're complex exponentials are solutions because remember we said our circuit doesn't have memory. So sorry, sorry, I take that back. Our circuit has memory. It doesn't, it's time invariant. It doesn't care what time it is. If you wake up at 05:00 A.M. and go test out your RC circuit. It's going to behave the same as it is going to behave now. That's a lot like being on a circle, because no matter where you are on a circle, it always everything looks the same. Okay. I wanted to put together a little animation to try to explain this. This is a complex exponential drawn as a vector, right? That point at the end of the vector is the value of our function. And this is the real and imaginary components of it. Notice that here I put an a frequency of 0.01. Don't worry about the units here. If I doubled like let me make this 0.03 should spinning faster, right? I can change its amplitude here. And now you can see it's bigger. So the amplitude of this complex exponential tells you how big the circle is. We've been talking about a unit amplitude up until now. And there's the phase, the phase is the initial value. So for the phase of zero, the complex exponential always starts. Basically, I can't draw over here, but basically with a, let me see if I can stop it at the right point. There are no roughly there. Right. So that's zero. I guess that's 03:00. 03:00 is the starting position of the starting phase. If I change the phase, then I'm just basically delaying when it starts and stops. I don't want my pencil here. Nope. Okay. Now here's the interesting part. What happiness that if we think about our linear system, our linear system is taking the past values of the input and summing it with the current values. So here if I put in a complex exponential, the past values of a complex exponential look the same, right? That's the circle argument. It just has a different face. It started at a different time. It's, the question is what happens if I add two complex exponentials? Well, you get a really boring picture. So, so first let me show you that not boring picture, not boring picture is if you have a different frequency. Here we go. So here's what happens when I'm adding two complex exponentials. There. The two little blue curves there once going in at the slow rate. The second one is going in at a faster rate. And you'll notice that when you sum them together, they're canceling out. They have the same amplitude. So at some values they're going to cancel each other out and it's going to trace out this curve. Let me just reload this page. Let's put in three times. So these curves are interesting. And this is certainly, if you look at the trace here, the black trace is certainly no longer a complex exponential. Complex exponential. It's just that simple shape. It's just the circle. Why didn't I get a circle? Because I added a second term which is at a different frequency, but that's not what a linear system does. A linear system adds another complex exponential at the same frequency, just delayed. So let's see what that looks like. So I need to change this frequency back to one same frequency. I just need to delay this, delay this by 1 rad. So what's the response? Well, I'm just summing those two blue arrows. And the result is the basically red arrow. And you can see that they sum together and it's boring. You're going to circle back, right? So the sum of two complex exponentials is giving us a complex exponential. Let's add up another one. Let's add a third one. Let's make the amplitude 30 this time. And let's give it another phase of two. Okay? Now you can see there's three arrows here. The first blue arrow, then the second block arrow, then the third little arrow, which has an amplitude of 30. They're summing together and giving us this red arrow. And it's still a complex exponential. So no matter you can convince yourself, it doesn't matter how many complex exponentials you add, you're still gonna get a complex exponential. The only thing that's going to change is the face. And that's what this equation is saying. This equation is saying like look, if you put a complex exponential into a linear system in steady-state, the output is gonna be another complex exponential with a phase shift and an amplitude shift, right? Because these are the previous values of the complex exponential, adding and modifying the current value. Okay? So that's it for today's lecture. It's time for one question. Shouldn't have said that too late. Alright, see you guys next time.
