Good. Okay. Yeah. All right. Good morning. Before we start. Any general questions. Okay, let's jump back into lecture. Last time we were talking about mutual inductors and transformers. So let's go back there and have a look. We've got the projector going. So mutually coupled inductors, it's probably for many of you, the first time you've, you've encountered them. It's more or less the analog of capacitance, right? What does capacitance really? We've talked about charge storage, energy storage. But there's another side of capacitance that I'm hoping you guys are starting to see, which is what happens in one conductor can influence another conductor. In other words, signals can jump from one conductor to another through the capacitance. This is kind of like action at a distance, right? You put charge on one conductor and then another conductor nearby response, the potential at that conductor changes the charge distribution on the other conductor also changes What's going on. Well, we know that current can't flow through vacuum, right? But electric fields can flow through vacuum. And so every time you change the charge distribution on one conductor, you're influencing pretty much the rest of the environment around you. And that influenced drops like the field drops with very quickly. So it's within the vicinity, in a close proximity of the first conductor. You have influence, right? Of course, if I'm talking about DC, if I just charge up a capacitor, let's say we put charge on a conductor and then we're done. Nothing changes, right? Signals can only jump if things change. So now if I modulate the charge on one conductor, I'll see the charges on the other conductors also changing in response. That's mutual capacitance. We didn't use the word mutual. We just call the capacitance. Over here though we're going to call mutual inductance the same phenomena of action at a distance, but now through the magnetic field. So if you run a current through a circuit, it generates a magnetic field. That magnetic field spreads out into space. It will cross other circuitry, right? Other loops. And if it's just a DC current, nothing happens. But now if you modulate that current, if you change it, it actually will induce changes in voltages and other circuits in the near vicinity. And you will get kind of this action at a distance. You can control a current over there by modulating the current over here. Okay? And this principle is actually used all over the place. It's short-range communication uses inductive coupling or mutual inductance. The coupling, mutual inductance coupling is another way of saying the same thing. And so what's a good example of a short-range communication system that uses inductive coupling. Want to have an idea or take a guess? Walkie-talkie? You could, but the range would be really short. And I'm talking like really short range. Bluetooth. No, bluetooth uses electromagnetic interactions basically. It's a good guess, but if you've ever tested your Bluetooth system, it actually can go pretty far, right? You can walk several meters away and it still works. Inductive charging. Yeah, that's actually one. So in this case we're not necessarily communicating, but we're sending energy. So it's a great example. So every time you use wireless charging, the energy is being transmitted through mutual coupling. So you have one loop, right? And you've noticed, but whenever you have these kind of inductive coupling systems that it always involves loops, right? You have loops. And if you'd like, take your, if you have like a watch the charges wirelessly, right? If you take the charger and rip it apart, you'll see coils inside, right? And they generate magnetic fields. And then there's a loop inside of your watch and it picks up the energy. And it charges its own battery. It's very convenient, for instance, if you have an implant and you want to charge an implant, and let's say I have a pacemaker or something in your brain. You don't wanna do surgery on somebody every month, right? Put it in a new battery. You have a battery that is biocompatible, implanted, and you can charge it wirelessly using inductive coupling. So that's an example of energy transfer. What about an example of communication? Near-field communication? Exactly. Nfc. Nfc. What's, what's another That's an acronym like what do you call that? In daily life? Yeah. It's basically every time you use any kind of RFID system, like to pay, to make a payment, right? When you tap your credit card or when you open the door of a building with your card, it's actually communication through the magnetic field. It's basically a mutual inductor. So it's very useful. And we can also, we also give this mutual inductor a very special name. We call it a transformer. It's a special kind of mutual inductor. Transformer is like an intentional system where you build two loops and you couple them very strongly. And the purpose is to, you know, there's the word transform in there. So what we talked about this last lecture, we're trying to transformers the voltage. We're trying to go from a high voltage to low voltage. In fact, the reason you might wonder why do we have AC in our houses, right? It's kinda silly. Because in my house, I have 120 v AC coming in the wall. But every device I plug into it internally just needs 12 v or 6 v or 3 v. So I have all these little things I have to plug into the wall to transform the 120 v down to 3 v or 5 v or 6 v, whatever it is. But almost all our devices use DC, right? And much lower voltages, because our transistors don't work with 100 v. Our transistors work with 3 v, 1 v. But why is it that historically, like today, if you're gonna build a house from scratch, you'd put USB outlets everywhere, right? Because that's much more useful. But why is it that traditionally we use AC voltages? Well, it has to do with how much energy it takes to actually transmit energy. Basically, how, how efficient is energy delivery? It actually depends on the voltage. If you were to build a system that delivered energy at low voltages, it would be extremely inefficient. So let's pick like 10 v as an example. Let's say I have a system that's 10 v, and I have a toaster, my house that needs a kilowatt, right? If you think about how much current, I'd have to run through the wires to get to a kilowatt. You very quickly and you realize they're gonna get I squared R losses. Not all in your house, which is not good, but also in the transmission lines that bring power to your house. So that power can actually completely outweigh the power that you're delivering. You might have to spend 10 kw to deliver the power that you're going to burn 1 kw. The solution is to go to higher voltages. Because the higher you go in voltage, the smaller the current. And the smaller the current, the smaller the I squared losses. So power is transmitted at the highest voltage possible. Long-range transmission happens at hundreds of thousands of volts. And this is primarily because we want to minimize how much power loss we have. I think there's a question, Yeah. Thank you. So why use it? They send pi voltage is good. Send DC, right? Why not send DC? Well, you have 100,000 v. Maybe when it gets to your poll, it's at 10,000 v. Who wants to bring 10,000 v? First of all, how did we go for 100,000? 10,000. That's the first problem we have to solve. But let's say we solve that problem right now we have 10,000 v coming into our house. You want to let your kid walk around. You guys don't have kids, but you want to walk around. And every time you look at that wire, you're like, wow, there's 10,000 v on there. It's bad enough that there's 100 v AC. Okay? Just transform it down to 100 v or 10 v, right? How do you transform a DC voltage? It's not easy. It's possible. I gave you guys a hint last lecture. But with AC signals, it's very easy to transform their voltages. So let's look at how we do it with AAC. So let me imagine, I have my voltage coming in here. This is V1 and this is V2. So again, some of you know the physics, others don't. So I'm not going to spend, you don't need to know this. But for those of you who know the physics, you can see here that there's two terms, whereas here there's just one term. So if this V1 generates a magnetic field, every loop that generates a magnetic field here only cuts across one loop over here. And we basically call this the turns ratio. So you might even see this when people draw transformers, they draw two inductors. They put a little bar here and I'll explain what that bar is in a minute. But they may write something like 21. Okay, so what does that mean? Well, for an ideal transformer, and we'll see where this equation comes from in a minute. It means that if you put a voltage V1 here, you get a voltage one-half v1 over here. So simply modifying the turns ratio in a transformer can change the voltage. Like magic, right? But this only works for AC circuits. If you send a DC current through the primary, the inductor just generates a magnetic field, the charges up, but it doesn't induce a voltage on the secondary, right? We call this the primary. We call this the secondary. On the other hand, the minute I send an AC signal, I can get, I can induce a voltage on the secondary, and I can manipulate that voltage. So what's now you can guess what's inside of here. Write what's inside of there is lots of turns right? To go from 10,000 v down to a few turns to go to 100 v or 240 v AC to get into your house. So let's, let's look at where these equations come from. And basically last lecture we talked about how the voltage in the first loop is not as given by d phi d t. But also there's a factor m, the I2 d t. And this has to do with the fact that if you run current through the secondary loop, that current will also generate a magnetic field in the first loop and induce a voltage. And likewise, we can write that v2 is m d i1 d t plus, let's call that L1. So we can call this L2, the I2 d t. So this is I1, now this is I2. Now there is actually 11 thing we should take care of here. One ambiguity, which is. If I run current through the second loop with the orientation shown right, with the direction I2 that I've shown. Does that generate a positive voltage or negative voltage on the primary? Now if you know the physics, you know what's going on. Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction is happening. And if you go back to your physics, you use the right-hand rule to figure out, okay, the fields or in this direction, current in that direction, I could figure out which direction the voltage induced is. Or you can use Lenz's Law. Again, if you haven't studied this stuff, don't worry about it. But the point is that it matters and the orientations of the loop matter if the loops are oriented in the same direction and we label them both in the same way that a positive current in one will induce a positive current and the other. If I flip the direction, and basically it's just a relabeling if I label the second loop in the opposite direction than a positive current in loop one will generate a negative voltage and the second loop. So how do we resolve this ambiguity while we use the dot convention? Thought I had a slide on it. There it is. This is the dot convention. So what the dot convention says is, first of all, where do you put the dot? It's telling you where the current is coming into the inductor. So that defines the positive orientation of the voltage and current. And basically over here, you can see the dots are in the same place. Therefore, the mutual inductance M we always take to be positive. And so the voltage induced on the primary and the secondary is in phase. So these are oriented in the same way. If, on the other hand, I put a dot over here on the opposite side of the secondary. That's telling me that if you induce a voltage in the secondary or the primary its reciprocal, then the voltage is going to have the negative face. So think about it like the drawings. If I go back to my drawing here, you'll notice that over here these loops are going in the same direction. So here the dot convention would be positive. But what if I run my current in the opposite direction, right? If I were to do something like this and still insist on defining the positive voltage in the same way, then it basically becomes negative. In fact, I don't even need to draw another loop because I have a single loop, it's symmetric. I can just say, what if I had labeled it like that? If I label things like this. And this is V2, this is V1, then I have to put the dark over here. So this dot convention is just simply a way of keeping track of orientations of these loops. Here I have an example with three loops. And you know, we've been talking about two loops. But you can see this generalizes. You've got as many loops as you want. Here we have three loops, V1, loop one loop to loop three. And you can see by the orientation of the loops, right? V3 is wound in this direction, whereas V2 and V1 are wound in the opposite direction, right? And so their magnetic fields essentially go in the opposite direction. So the voltage that they induced is going to be the opposite. Okay, So what about this bar that I talked about? Why do we sometimes draw a bar here? Well, this bar indicates that there's a core. You can build an air core inductors. But in general, most transformers and inductors at lower frequencies used magnetic cores to boost the inductance and to improve the efficiency of the transformer to link more flux lines between the primary and the secondary and to prevent losing flux lines. Again, these are details that I think I'm going to skip for now. Okay. We talked about RFID. Yeah. In fact, this is what an RFID tag looks like if you rip apart your ID card, I don't recommend you do so, but maybe find one, an old card that's not working anymore. And you look inside and you'll see that actually there's a chip. That chip is the RFID chip that basically, when you apply power to it, it demodulates the signal coming in. And there's only two lines coming in. So actually from the same lines that power comes in, it's going to observe a modulation of the power, that modulation of the powers the signal. So it sends it as a sequence. It says, identify herself, right? Another tax says, I'm tagged number blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then the RFID reader system will say, Oh, you are authorized or not, you're not authorized, right? So that information goes back and forth. In fact, you don't even need two-way communication. You just need to tell the task, the tag, what's your ID and the tag response. So this is actually, you can see the loops here. This is the, these are the windings of the transformer. This is the secondary winding of the transformer. You can see there's something that looks like a capacitor here. I don't know the details of this, but most RFID tags look something like this. And of course, it's a spiral inductor rather than a solenoid. Because who wants to carry around a solenoid, right? Everyone wants to carry around something flat and their wallet. One more interesting thing about mutual coupling. This is this has to do with why we twist wires. If you've ever wondered. Why do we? Well, how many people know that all those cables carrying data, like Ethernet cables are twisted wires. Yeah. Some of you knew some of you didn't realize ROE grip up one of those wires and maybe not on a working land. But basically, if you look inside these cables is cable bundles or even if basically just take a cable that's like, you know, cables today, they're actually rated by different categories. You find an old cable, it's pretty much junk because it only works at like 10 mbps. So you can cut it and have a look inside. Or you can just go on the Internet and look at a picture. What you're going to see is twisted Paris. These twisted pairs, each one of them is a connection, is a channel. And it's basically a positive and negative reference. You realize that they're actually wasting material, right? Why do they need to send a negative reference they could have just sent. In this case, I see four signals and some reference signal there. So we have nine wires. They could have sent for wires and just the reference signal, right? They didn't do that. Why not? You have all the tools to answer this question. Yeah. Demonstrated before it's 180 degrees out of phase on the return signal. So if it's equal to cancel. Yeah, very good. So let's backup and you're absolutely right, but let's actually back up and just talk about we can build up to what you just said. So first stage is inductance and wires, right? When you have wires, they will have inductance. How do we find the inductance in the wires? Well, we have to figure out what loop. What's the loop that forms that inductance, right? So if I have a wire here, and this is my sometimes called the return wire. And you put a voltage source over here. Notice that this forms a loop. You didn't intend to build a wire, right? You didn't intend to build an inductor. What you just built one. And you might say, you know, who cares? These wires are 1 mm apart, right? So this dimension here might just be a millimeter. But guess what? This dimension is, 100 m. So it adds up. So you basically have this. And you might say, Well, what's the big deal? Well, the big deal is you already know that if you have inductance and resistance, it just looks like an RC circuit you're gonna get. Instead of getting nice clean waveforms are going to get distorted pulses. If you're doing digital communication, all your pulses are gonna get distorted. Later on we will see situations even worse. So the solution is really simple. The solution is make the get these wires as close as possible, right? And so you just physically bring in the wires. So don't share a reference, right, going back over here. This is the reference. Don't share that. Transmit every signal and it's returned signal together. Put them as physically close together as possible. Now if I want to have two wires that are touching, I'd have to use glue and all that glue would get expensive. So a cheaper solution is just twist the wires together, right? But maybe the first person who built this didn't even realize that, that process of twisting has other benefits, right? So first of all, putting the wires close together, sending the return signal with the domain signal reduces the inductance. That's good. But twisting the wires has an additional benefit. Does anybody see what that is? If you're a fast reader and you can look at the slides and alright, well, nowadays you guys probably have never experienced this. But when I was a kid, sometimes when you picked up the phone and your house, right, you could listen in and hear your neighbors talking. Wouldn't be a very strong signal, like you need good hearing. But you could definitely hear a conversation going on. And so what's happening? Well, the telephone signal coming into your house was in a cable bundle, right? The whole building was why are added together into one cable bundle and there's a fit. There was a physical wire and there still is a physical wire from your house going all the way to the central office where the phone company would route signals to you. Obviously now that's changed to cable modems and other kinds of optical cables. But the principle is the same as we'll see. So when you have these two wires sitting next to another pair of wires in close proximity. We just learned that you have mutual coupling. So when you talk on your wire, that's an AC signal. It has a d by d t in it, and it induces a signal on another wire. So your neighbors wire picks up a small fraction of your conversation. And if you're not talking, you can basically pick up and hear that conversation. Obviously that was due to bad wiring. Wire things correctly. It's not going to be an issue, but twisting the wires together substantially reduces the coupling. And to understand why, you have to realize that, go back to that dot convention slide. When the wires are going in one orientation, the coupling is positive. When the wiring is in the other orientation, the coupling is negative. What was the Twisted wire? We're continuously changing the orientation. I can't go all the way around but you get the point, right. We're continuously changing the orientation, the wire. So we're picking up a positive signal, negative signal, positive cycle, negative signal. And no matter where the other wire is, right, the other pair of wires are. If they're up here, because we're rotating, we're also flipping orientation with respect to the vertical. So with respect to every angle, we're actually canceling out the coupling over distance. Over a short distance we couple, but on average we don't couple. So twisted pairs are great way to shield signals from each other. So shielding is the key idea. The alternative to twisting these wires together would be to actually put a metal shield and surrounding every pair of conductors with a shield. That's expensive. And it's also overkill for many applications are super-duper like isolation. You twist and you put a shield. Okay? One last thing I wanted to mention here with transformers and mutual inductance is it has some, some Berkeley history involved. So g of phi circuits, you may have heard of them. You may have dealt with them. In a modern house. All the outlets that are near like water sources, like in your bathroom, your kitchen. They have to be GFP outlets. And GFA outlets have a circuit breaker built into the outlet so they can shut down very quickly. The idea is that wet skin conducts electricity much better. Soapy skin, wet skin conducts electricity much better than dry skin. So if you're in the bath tub or if you're washing dishes and you happen to touch a live wire and current can move through much faster and much easier, and that could be fatal. So a GFR circuit is designed to detect that and to shut the outlet off. And there's a little switch you may have, maybe you've actually encountered that switch inside the outlet. There is a switch that can then reset that outlet. So how does this circuit work? Well, the idea is There's two wires coming into your house. If the current is flowing through the device, let's say your toaster or your microwave oven. Whatever current goes into the oven, better come out of the oven. If the current coming out of the oven is not equal to the current going into the oven. Guess what? It's coming out of you or something else. That's not good, that's not how it's designed. If you accidentally touch a wire, then you're the return path. Very bad, right? You're gonna be toast. No pun intended. So what a GFR does is it carefully measures, and this was invented by a Berkeley professor. It basically measures the current going in and coming out through here. And not nominally when these currents are equal to each other, the flux generated by this one and this one cancel out and generate zeros, zero current, zero voltage and zero current across here. So under nominal conditions, the relay line has 0 v on it because there's positive flux going through it and negative flux from the return, the moment the currents are imbalanced. Like for instance, if the return current now is flowing through here, then these currents are not balanced. So maybe this is too coming in, just one coming out, or three coming in, one coming out. Now we have a voltage built up over here because there's flux. From here, but not enough negative flux from here. We get net flux through this loop that indicates something bad has happened and the relay shuts off the circuit. Okay? So that's very important for electrical safety. And it gets cool to know that many, many years ago a Berkeley professor invented it. Alright, any questions? By the way, I tend to talk about some high-level material is somebody said. And some people are stressed out. Like do we need to know all this stuff? Well, after every lecture I'm posting a key concepts. A few pages. You guys may have seen it already. I put in all the key concepts for all the lectures I've given so far. That's the stuff you need to know. And I'll indicate like this is key, this is important. This is background. And if you're still in doubt, let me know and I'll revise those and make it as clear as possible. For instance, you're not going to see this on the final exam, right? Okay. No questions. Yeah. Yeah, It's a good question. You can just swap the polarity, but sometimes it's just convenient to say this is the plus terminal, but actually it's not, right, so it's just a label. You can get away without ever using it. But it's still useful because it tells you where you're defining the current is going in. It's telling you where you're defining. If you put a current into one loop, where does the other current get induced? Okay, we're going to start a new module, which is RLC circuits. Basically, we're going to combine the capacitors and inductors and see what happens when we put it all together. So probably the simplest RLC circuit we can think of is this one. It's a series RLC circuit. And even though it's so simple, don't let this, the humble origin of this circuit for you, it actually is very important. It appears all over the place. And surprisingly in many, many different applications, not just in just not in electrical engineering, but in other applications as well. Like if you look at chemical resonance, if you're looking at a interferometry experiment, you might find that the behavior is like an LTR circuit. So the resonance that happens, the bandwidth, the quality factor, all that stuff shows up in many, many places. So let's, let's just look at this circuit for now. If we want to analyze this circuit, go back to our basics. We say, Okay, we can do a KVL or KCL. In this case, there's just a loop. So we can say that the voltage source V of S is equal to the voltage drop across the inductor plus the voltage drop across the resistor, plus the voltage drop across the capacitor. And using our knowledge, well, this is just a simple inductor. So the voltage drop is L DIDT. And the voltage drop across the resistor, well that's just I times R. And the voltage across the capacitor, well, that's the integral of the current coming in. So we could write that as the initial voltage plus the integral one over c0t I of tau D tau. So we don't have a differential equation, we have an integral differential equation. There's both an integral in here and a differential operator. Well, let's write the equations in a slightly different form. We could have also, in this case, we use the current through the circuit as our variable. We could also write things in terms of the voltage on the capacitor. So let's do that. Let's see if that gets us away from writing an integral differential equation. So this is the voltage on the capacitor. Well, we know what the current through a capacitor is. A current through a capacitor is C dvc, d t. So I can say that v is L DI DT plus the IR drop plus VC. And now I can try to write everything in terms of the voltage. Well, this one's easy. This I could just substitute RC dvc t, t. But what do I do over here? Well, if I take the derivative of DIDT, I get, let's see, second derivative with respect to the capacitor voltage. So that means that I can simplify this to LC d squared V c d t squared. So now I have a differential equation, but it involves a second-order derivative, which we haven't dealt with before. So how do we solve this second-order differential equation? Well, first of all, the second-order differential equation, in order to solve it, you need two initial conditions, not a single initial condition. Why is that? Well, very simply, there's two states in the circuit. There's the initial current through the inductor and the initial voltage on the capacitor. Equivalently, there's initial charge on the capacitor and there's initial flux in the inductor. We know from everything we've studied before that inductors and capacitors have memory. Their future value depends on the past values, and you need some to know how far in the past you need to go. At some, we have to say, well, maybe at time t is equal to zero, the capacitor was charged to so and so, and the inductor had so at such and such current in it, then we can know what the future is without specifying the state of the system. The state of the system, which is the voltage on the capacitor and the current through the inductor. We can't say anything about the future. So to solve this problem, we need the initial conditions. So these are the initial conditions. And we can also say this is that these are the initial states. This is the initial state of the system. This perspective is actually very important. It's going to come up again and again, not only in electrical circuits, but in many other systems like you build a robot. You want to know what the future state of the robot is. You need to specify the current state of the robot. And there'll be a differential equation very similar to this one that describes the behavior of the robot over time. Okay? So this is a kind of a daunting differential equation to solve that source voltage is arbitrary. We gotten lucky with the first-order differential equation, the integrating factor method. We were able to solve it in general and say, yeah, this is the integral, this is the solution for all time. Over here, we're gonna take a different approach. We're not going to try to solve it in one step, but we're going to do is solve it for probably the most important input signal, which is a DC input. Basically, this DC input is really not a DC input because a DC input implies that the voltage has always been a VDD for all of time. What we're saying is that let's suppose that this circuit initially we're at some voltage, whatever you want, the initial state. And then we turn on a DC source. And why is that important? Well, we talked about the step response before. The idea of a step response is, this is our system, right? Rlc circuit. And maybe we're taking the output over here, which is the voltage across the capacitor. And we're interested in knowing, if I put a step on the input, right? This is the voltage source of the input. Initially it's at 0 v, it goes up to 1 v. If I can solve this problem, then I can solve another interesting problem, which is the pulse response, right? I can take a superposition and solve what happens when I put a Paulson. And then I can generalize and say what happens when I put a pulse train in, right? And they don't even need to be periodic. Once you solve this problem, then we can solve this by superposition of the sources. And then this by the superposition of the sources, we can delay the sources and solve, and we take advantage of linear time and variance. And so we can solve these more complicated problems. So solving this first problem is actually pretty important. So here we're saying that the source at time t is equal to zero. All of a sudden pops up to a value of VDD. And now we want to see how the circuit behaves, how the circuit responds to that. Okay? Now, we need to take advantage of the fact that we can basically use our intuition for what happens if we wait a very long time. So we can say if this circuit reaches steady state for a DC input, then we know what's going to happen. So let, let's look at the circuit for steady-state. So let me actually just draw a picture here. What do I mean by that? Well. This voltage is going to VDD, right? It's going from 0 v to VDD. Like this. You could think of this as a circuit as turning on steady-state DC. Steady state means that we wait a very long time and let the circuit settled down, do its thing, right? It's thing is the natural response. It's going to respond, do some crazy things. But eventually it's going to settle down. And it's going to settle down to the point where things don't change anymore. When things don't change anymore, this is going to go to a constant. So this is going to be zero. That means the current through the circuit goes to zero. Also. The current going through zero and its derivative going to zero means that in steady-state, the capacitor is an open circuit. So let's just erase it. An inductor is a short circuit. So you can redraw the circuit. It's so simple, I can draw it here in the corner. That's the steady DC steady-state circuit. So I know what the steady-state solution is. The steady-state solution is simply that the capacitor gets charged to VDD. Okay? So that is in fact the particular solution of this differential equation. Right? Remember the particular solution or the forced response is a solution which is due to the input source. Ignoring what the circuit likes to do, It's a natural response. So the force solution here is really easy to guess. It's just a constant. You put a constant input, you get a constant output. Go back and look at this differential equation. We can ask ourselves, hey, is that a solution? Is a DC steady-state solution, a solution to this equation. And indeed it is, right, because if V of C is just equal to VDD, then the derivative is zero. The second derivative is zero. These terms go away and this is our solution. So we can find the particular solution. It's just a constant. And we know what the constant is because in steady-state, the voltage has to charge up to VDD. That's it. So we know the particular solution, but we're not done, right? We know that every time you have a particular solution, you have to also add up the solution to the homogeneous equation because the homogeneous equation satisfies the same differential equation with zero inputs. So I can always take the homogeneous solution, add it to the force solution, and I'm gonna get another solution, right? So that's an important thing. I think there's a little bit of confusion on this, partially because there's different terminology for the same thing for differential equations. If I look at different books, I can see that people sometimes call this the homogeneous solution versus the inhomogeneous solution. Sometimes this is called the forced or the particular solution. And then also the homogeneous solution. What's another name for it? In the literature? The natural solution, yeah. So that's why it's confusing because we have all these different names. In fact, if we think could probably come up with a couple of more homogeneous solution, natural solution. Oh yeah. We also sometimes call this the transient solution because it's something that's temporary and then it goes away, usually. So the inhomogeneous force solution, particular solution, sometimes the steady-state solution, right? And so on. So the key idea here is that if I know, what, If I know V of t is equal to some particular solution? I can always construct another solution which involves the homogeneous solution. Oh yeah, This reminds me of another name. This is sometimes called the complimentary solution. In fact. You'll see this a lot with second-order differential equations. They'll take a second-order differential equations. We're gonna find out that there's more than one homogeneous solution factors to. In a math class, you can prove that for an nth order differential equation, There's n homogeneous solutions. Actually will be able to prove that next week too. But the key idea here is that you have n solutions. They're linearly independent from each other. And to form the complimentary solution, we take a linear combination of those individual homogeneous solutions. Now this is a good thing because the particular solution may not satisfy the initial conditions, right? In fact, if I told you that the capacitor is initially discharged than this particular solution doesn't work. Right? Because this particular solution says, Oh, the outputs at VDD will clearly that's not right. The output starts at zero. It has to transition and eventually become VDD. That transition process is going to be provided by the homogeneous solution. So that's why we use the initial conditions to find these constants to satisfy the initial condition. And then those in turn will tell us what the solution is. So in this particular case, the homogeneous solution of course, is the solution where you put the source to zero. And again, we're back to the guessing game. Remember, if we can guess the solution and its correct, we're done. And it's unique. So the exponential function has been our best friend and so far in this class, every time we see a differential equation, we put it in there and it helps us out. It solves the equation. Essentially the exponential functions converting these differential equations into algebraic equations. Because if you take a derivative of an exponential, you get another exponential times a constant. You integrate an exponential. You get a constant plus the exponential. You take ten derivatives of the exponential. You get that constant to the tenth power, again, another exponential. The exponential will always solve these differential equations no matter what the order, right? An exponential we'll solve. And because the exponential is never zero, we can just cancel it out and we're left with an algebraic equation. So let, let's do that over here. Let's assume that v of t is some a e to the j omega t. Ok? Actually let me call it S T because I don't know if this is real complex, so just call it S. Okay? So then this equation becomes a e to the st plus RC. Take a derivative, I'm gonna get a S, e to the st. And then I'm going to take a second derivative. So I'm gonna get a S squared e to the st. Notice that every term has the same exponential. It doesn't do anything. It's never zero. I can divide it out and it's gone. Also this constant a can be anything. So I'll just divide it out. What remains is this equation. In this case, we get a second-order equation, which is one plus RC times S. So this is a linear term. Plus LC times S squared. Now this equation, it's so common that you can write it in a more common form, which is applicable not just to electrical circuits, but also to mechanical systems, to control systems and so on. And so that common form takes on the following form. So first of all, if we look at these various terms, I can say, well, what are the units of L times C? I can go back to kinda basic physics and try to figure out those units. But there's an easier way. Because look, this is e to the st. So S has units of one over time, right? We call one over time frequency. So S has units of frequency. And so that means that if I have S squared here, the product LC should have units of time, right? Time squared in fact, because it's getting multiplied by S squared. So we're going to call the product LLC tau. Okay? And in fact, we also can define an angular frequency, which is basically one over tau. So this should be actually this is tau square, there's a square root. This is one over square root. Okay? So what about this constant over here, I have r times c. Let me just play around with these constants, R times C. We're saying we're going to define this frequency omega squared as one over root LC. I can substitute here. Let's see. So for reasons that will become clear later on, I'm going to define a parameter q, which is the ratio of Omega naught times L over R, might say, well, why are you doing this? But it'll become clear later on. So for now, that's just a convention. If I define q and this way. And if I define zeta as one-half of q 11/2 times q, then this term RC, can actually be translated into two times zeta. Again, don't worry about the constants. I could spend some time explaining why we do this, but it'll become clear much later. For now, just say, somebody likes to put the equation into the simplest possible form so that the solution is nice and easy and clean. So if we look at this equation, this is simply a quadratic equation. If we define the variable S Tau to be the solution, then the roots of this, this is your high-school quadratic equation. Minus b plus or minus b squared minus four ac over to a, write, you write down the solution. So everybody here can write the solution down. And you'll see that we did a good job picking our constants, right? We've picked our constants to make the solution as simple as possible. So it just involves one parameter zeta and one parameter tau, right? So the roots of this equation tell us what the frequency of the natural response is going to be enough. The term frequency I'm using here a little bit loosely, but we'll come back, remember the complex exponential and how it goes around the circle, right? The frequency is how fast it goes around that circle. Again, we'll come back to that. Don't worry if it's not clear yet. In fact, it may not even go around the circle, which we'll find out. It depends a lot on the solution, zeta. Yes. Okay, don't worry about Q. Yeah, So for now, let's just say I have this equation here. It's a second-order quadratic equation. I want to solve it. You can solve it, right? It'll involves L's and C's and all this stuff. But we're just saying let's clean up. Let's just put this equation into standard form. We're just going to call again for forget Q. It is the quality factor which we'll study later. But we're just going to, if you just substitute here, you can say RC is equal to two zeta Y2, so that I get this nice clean solution for the equation, That's it. So this is just a way of putting the equation into standard form. Okay? So this solution is interesting because let me write it over here. We find there's two roots. Possibly two roots may be one. Write the plus or minus tells us that there's two roots. And the roots depend on the value of Gamma. We can immediately see that there's three interesting cases. There's gamma less than one, gamma equal to one, and gamma, gamma zeta greater than one. So let's start out with zeta less than one. Excuse me, greater than one. That's the easiest case. This is S Tau knot S. So if zeta is greater than one, what can we say about the solution? Two distinct roots, right? Because there's a plus and minus involved. And what can you say about the value of these routes? Are they positive? Are they negative or they're complex? They're real roots because the square root is always a positive number, right? If gamma is greater than, zeta is greater than one, zeta squared is greater than one. So we're taking the square root of a positive number. So we get distinct roots. And you'll notice that the second term is always less than the first term. The first term is just Theta, the second term is zeta squared. And then you subtract one, and then you take the square root. So it's always less than zeta, which means that even if we add it to the first term, we still end up with a negative root. So we have two distinct roots. Roots our negative. Okay, and that's important because, why is that important word? The homogeneous solution we're saying is e to the st. And we're basically finding what values of S satisfy. So we just found that S is equal to one over tau, zeta minus plus or minus zeta squared minus one. So now we're finding that the solution, the homogeneous solution involves two roots, both negative. We've seen these before. These are decaying exponentials. So that's. Pretty much very similar to what we got with RC circuits will twist here. There's this extra parameter. We have two time constants instead of one time constant. But an LC circuit, if zeta is bigger than one, results in two decaying exponentials, That's the homogeneous solution or the natural response. We call, There's a name for this, we call this overdamped. And the reason why we call it an overdamped solution will become clear when we talk about the other cases such as the underdamped. Now, zeta equals to one is interesting because if this term is one, the square root goes away zero. And you're taking minus eta plus or minus zero. That's just one solution. Right? So there's one root is easy. And in fact it's just given by minus one over tau. We need to figure out what the other route is. This is called critically damped by the way. And then finally, we have a really interesting case which is new. New to us, is what happens if this parameter is less than one? If it's less than one, we're taking the square root of a minus one, so we know the solution is complex. We get two complex roots. And in fact, we can see, say, something a little bit more about these routes. We can say that there are complex conjugates of each other. So let's, let's actually see where that comes from. And this, of course, we're going to call underdamped will not of course, but you'll see it'll become a of course later. Well, let me just show you the of course part, which is not really just plug-in the solutions and look at what they look like. If we take these three cases and just plug the solution in. We're basically saying our, let's say our initial condition is the capacitor is discharged. And then we hook up this voltage source at time t equals zero. What happens? We know the steady-state solution is the capacitor is going to charge up to VDD. Now, again, as a function of these parameters, we can say that, oh yeah, here's our case for zeta is equal to two. It just exponentially approaches just like our RC circuits. Nothing interesting is happening really beyond a simple first-order differential equation. It's hard to see, but there's actually two exponentials here, not just one. The critically damped solution, which will have to find the second route in a minute. It gets to the final value. Pretty fast. You can see faster than the case of two. And then it just stays there and it doesn't do anything interesting. But when the roots become complex, something really interesting happens is that we overshoot the circuit, overshoots the mark, and then it undershoots the mark and it oscillates. And eventually it gets to the final answer. So we need to understand what's going on here. We can see that this is happening because this e to the st, if this becomes complex, Let's write S as a plus j Beta or B. So this becomes e to the a, e to the j. And this lets put in time here. So we can see that this is the, let me just come over here. This is just our normal exponential decay. We'll show in a minute that this a is always less than zero. And so this is an exponential decay. And this guy we've met before, right? This was our complex exponential, which is just going around the circle. So this is the oscillatory part of the solution, is just going around the circle. And the amplitude, it's spiraling towards the origin, right? It starts out with an amplitude. Time t is equal to zero with a full amplitude of one, we just look at this term here. And then as time goes on, it spirals its way down into the origin, eventually gets to the origin. The homogeneous solution is essentially gone, right? If you wait long enough, but it doesn't, it goes out with a kick by spiraling its way to the origin. This is where, this is how we get this interesting solution here. I lost it anyhow, that's the picture of the solution. Sorry, there we go. This is where the origin of this oscillation behavior comes from. And you can show that the smaller zeta is, the bigger this oscillation. In fact, you can ask, ask yourself the question, well, what happens? If zeta goes away? Zeta goes to zero. Then the solution is purely oscillatory. And equivalently, if we go back and see it, well, how do we define zeta zero? Remember, zeta was defined in terms of the RC time constant of the circuit. Remember, we just did, we just said that zeta is equal to RC divided by two. Well, if, if zeta is zero, that means either r is equal to zero or c is equal to zero. Okay? Let's take the case that's r is equal to zero. Because if C is zero, our, our differential equation doesn't look as interesting. With r is equal to zero, this term goes away. And we still have a second-order differential equation. If we put C is equal to zero, all of this goes away and nothing happens, right? So it's not interesting. So let's just make R is equal to zero. And we still have a second-order differential equation. But now the solution is purely imaginary. Roots are both imaginary. And that means that it never spirals towards the origin. It always just spins around the origin with a constant radius. It never goes away. And we can understand that as a statement of conservation of energy. If resistance is zero and you have initial charge on the capacitor, that charge is just going to turn into magnetic flux and then back into voltage, and then magnetic current, and then voltage and current. But it's just going to oscillate between the inductor and the capacitor forever, the energy is not going to go away. Now the perfect analogy to this LC circuit is a mass spring system. Okay? Now, even though the spring looks like an inductor, what does the spring represent? Spring stores energy. It stores potential energy, right? As the mass is, the mass goes up, it's the potential energy kx Hooke's law. That spring gets loaded and it's storing the energy. So the spring is the capacitance. On the other hand, the mass. As it's moving, it has kinetic energy, right? It's storing energy in its kinetic energy and it has a tendency to move. It has momentum, right? In order to slow it down, you have to pull on it. You need the spring to yank on it to say, Hey, come back the other direction. So the mass has momentum and it represents the inductance of the circuit. But where's the r? Well, we know that if you had a perfect spring and a perfect mass in vacuum and you set them into motion. What would happen? Would just go up and down forever, right? It's kinda like our solar system, right? Like the orbits of the planets, they're just happening. There's very little loss. So our day is not getting shorter and shorter. We're not getting closer and closer to the sun. Well, we are, but it's such a negligible amount, right? So again, we're not spiraling towards the sun. This circuit is not spiraling down to zero. It just keeps oscillating because there's no loss. So to introduce loss, we have to put a damper or something like that. So we have to say there's friction or introduced actually a damper like put something in here that if this moves back and forth, like this might be oil. And this is like a rod that goes into here. So as this moves up and down, increase the amount of friction because this rod now is going through this pipe full of liquid and that's damping the motion. So here we're damp the motion. Then instead of getting this oscillation, you might get something like this. And the the rate at which it decays depends a lot on how much loss you have in the system. The same is true over here. How quickly the homogeneous solution decays is going to be dependent on R, but not just on our, it's going to be dependent on other things as well. It's really how much energy you can store compared to how much energy or losing per cycle. We'll come back to that perspective soon. There's another good analogy that we have actually for this, which was something I think I talked about last lecture or the lecture before that. Which is we can think of capacitors as water tanks, right? And to make this analogy kinda work. I'm going to use two capacitors. And I'm going to say, look, this is, this pipe has resistance in it. And it also has momentum, right? The water moving through here is in motion, so it has momentum, so it has inductance. And then over here I have two capacitors. So remember in homework you guys did the problem without the inductor, but now you can go back and do this problem with the inductor and you'll see something very interesting, which is as the one tank discharges, you don't just discharge like this, right? Well, you would if there's a lot of loss, That's the overdamped case. If the water tank just discharges and brings the other tank to halfway point like it basically the same level, the equalise, right? So this one is going down, the water level is going down. This water level goes up until the water levels are equal. That's the steady-state solution. If that just happens in a boring manner, we say that's overdamped. If that actually happens like this, the water levels sloshing back and forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth until they settle. Eventually, we say that that's underdamped. What's happening? Of course, we talked about this. This is the inductance because as this tank starts to discharge, it introduces momentum, right? We talked about the waterwheel keeping things in motion. Even without the water wheel, just the amount of kinetic energy that we're imparting on the liquid that might be enough to keep it going so that it actually overshoots the mark. If we wanted to make this overshoot even more, then we'll introduce that waterwheel that we drew last time, right? So this is exactly same as perfect analogy for the systems for an electrical circuit. The amount of overshoot, how long it takes to discharge all that stuff is here. It's related to how much initial water we have, how much water we're losing per cycle. We can make it all exact as you'll see in a minute. Now the slides, I'll go through them quickly. Goes through the general procedure. So we should go through it. It's kinda boring. It's just like plugging in the numbers, but it's important to go through it. So we're basically saying that look, our solution is going to, the voltage on the capacitor is the steady-state solution, the particular solution, plus the homogeneous solution. And for the homogeneous solution, I have constants a and b, which I don t know, right? To find what those constants are, I can use initial conditions. So I need to know what's the initial voltage on the capacitor. At time t is equal to zero. If I plug in zero, these terms just go to one. At time t is equal to zero. And so I get vDD plus a plus b equals whatever the initial condition is. If the initial condition is the capacitor is discharged, the sum of the three has to equal to zero. The second initial condition is related to the current in the inductor. The current in the inductor is CDVDT. If I specify what this is at time t is equal to zero. That's my second initial condition. Well, if I take a derivative over here, the first term of course is zero, it's just a constant. The second term is going to give me S1, S1 plus S2 B E to the S to T. Now if I plug in time zero, I just get S1 plus S2. So using that second boundary condition, I get a second equation, which I thought I had written down. But here it is. It's basically S1 plus S2. B has to equal whatever the initial current is. In this case, we're saying it's zero. We're saying that the circuit is initially at rest. There's no current through the inductor. There is no voltage on the capacitor. Obviously, we can change that and the solution for a and B will change. But for the zero case, these are the equations I have two equations, two unknowns, equation one and equation two. If I solve these two equations, I have a and B, I have the solution. So let's do that. Let's solve for a and B. Here they are, here is equation one. Here's equation to solve them, try to keep the solution as generic as possible. Introduce sigma, which is the ratio of S1 and S2. And for the case that you have distinct roots, this is the solution. Two-week exponential, exponential, one exponential to an a and B turn out to be these constants. Ok? So this case is, we can run through it, it's pretty, pretty easy, no problem. The critically damped case where we only find one solution is actually more complicated. And there's different ways of finding the second solution. Most of those are out of scope. They involve a little knowledge of differential equations and Ron skins, if you've studied them. Or you can get the second solution through a very clever limiting process, which is to say, let me go back to the known solution and take the limit as this parameter approaches one and see what happens. And this is tricky. You're probably better off starting out with a complex solution. In which case, in the limiting process, you're gonna get something like sine of x over x, which you know the limit is one. And you can use that to show that the second sub homogeneous solution involves this extra factor of t. So instead of just being a complex exponential, It's a linear term times a complex exponential, which also decays because every good exponential can beat a polynomial function in a foot race, right? So at the end of the day, the second solution, right? This is going like t. This is going like that. You take the product. And so it might change things a tiny bit, right? But it's still going to be more or less something that decays exponentially. And the under-damped case we talked about, we get basically a real and imaginary part. The real part is going to give us the decay. The imaginary part is going to give us this oscillation. Let's see where that comes about. So when we solve for a and B, what we notice is that the solution, if we go back over here, when we solve for these two, we have they kind of look similar to each other. Depends on what S1 and S2 are. So what if S1 and S2 are the solution of this quadratic equation? So S1 tau is equal to minus zeta plus or minus j one minus zeta squared. Notice that this is the real part and this is the imaginary part. The real part, as I discussed earlier, is always negative. That means that that is always going to be an envelope decay. Multiplying the imaginary part, the imaginary part is called their complex conjugates. In fact, this is S1 and S2. S1 is sum plus j. And then S2 is just the complex conjugate of S1. Okay? So how is that important? Well, if I look at this solution for a and b, if I take the complex conjugate of the numerator, of course, is just a constant. And so then I need to take the complex conjugate of sigma. Well, what's the complex conjugate of sigma? This complex conjugate of sigma is I'll just call it alpha plus j beta, alpha minus j beta. Let's take the complex conjugate. Well that gives me alpha minus j beta alpha plus j beta. In other words, the complex conjugate of sigma is just one over sigma. So using that, I went through it pretty fast, but you can verify that on your own. If I take the complex conjugate of a, this just as one sigma. If I multiply through by sigma, I get the equation for b. Again, I went through it really fast, but this is simple algebra. You guys can do it at home. The important point is that these constants a and b are now complex conjugates of each other. And remember one of them, they both have the same decay factor. But one of them is rotating in one direction. It's complex exponential rotating clockwise, and one is rotating counterclockwise. And you guys all know hopefully by now by reviewing your complex Euler's theorem and everything that if you take two complex exponentials that are spinning in the opposite direction, you can get there either their real part or the imaginary part to cancel. If you get the real part to cancel, you get a sine function. If you get their imaginary parts that cancel, you get a cosine function. So that means that this is just a sinusoid. And here we write it as cosine omega t plus some phase. This is the oscillatory behavior that we're talking about. This is why it does that funny business of doing this, right? So again, this is the decay rate. This is the real part. And you'll notice that the smaller the zeta is, the slower it's going to decay. And then this frequency is approximately omega naught one minus gamma squared, where omega naught is one over tau. So as theta goes to zero, this frequency becomes exactly omega naught, which is sometimes called the natural frequency of the circuit. It's the frequency at which the circuit likes to oscillate. If you take the loss away, it will just oscillate at this frequency forever. And again, I can't overemphasize how important this circuit is. Just to give you an example of how, you know, many, many applications of this circuit. Look at the clock on the wall. How does it keep its time? Guess what? There's an LC circuit in there. There's an LC circuit. Keeping time. Write that thing doesn't have GPS on it, right? It's not synchronized with the satellites, is just keeping time fairly accurately by letting you know an LC circuit oscillates and counting how many times it oscillates. Simple counter. In fact, before we had LC circuits, it also had another second-order differential equation, keeping it moving. What was that second-order differential equation from? The pendulum, right? Either had a mass spring system or had a pendulum. Pendulum is oscillating. That's keeping time. Every circuit that you own has dozens of LC oscillators. Essentially keeping time. That takes me to the end of today's lecture. We'll pick this up next time.
