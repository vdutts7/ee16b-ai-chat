Morning class. Brief announcement. If you ever lose anything, should check this desk up here in front of the classroom. There's usually phones, eyeglasses, water bottles, or in case you need something that's a good place to check. Alright, hopefully everyone had a good long weekend and get started. Any questions? So this will be my last week lecturing for awhile. So we'll be wrapping up circuits module this week. So let's, let's pick up where we left off. We were looking at AC circuits. And the nice thing about AC circuits is that once you take care of that impedance, right? Once you convert everything into impedances, everything you learned about resistive circuits just naturally maps into impedance AC circuits. So in some ways, you don't have to learn anything new. We just have to realize you can use all the things that you know and love when you're doing circuit analysis. So for instance, of course, KCL and KVL apply for the harmonics steady-state solution. So we set up the equations and the exact same way. Nothing new. All the network theorems can be mapped into AC versions. For instance, simple things like voltage dividers, current dividers. They also work with AC circuits, except instead of using resistance or conductance, use impedance and admittance. Source superposition. If you're solving a complicated problem, you can solve it one source at a time and then take a superposition of the solutions that also works. Thevenin and Norton will do an example today. Thevenin and Norton also apply. So very convenient. I'll go through that very quickly with a few examples and then we'll switch to something new. Ac power. How does power flow in AC circuits? And we'll finish up with maximum power transfer theorem. And an application which is the RFID problem that we looked at earlier, will actually solve it in a steady-state domain and figure out how RFIDs work. So lots of stuff to look at. Let's get started. Okay, so very quick review. The only thing that changes if you have a circuit that involves inductors, capacitors, mutual inductors, you just map that into an impedance circuit. So this is an R-naught, an L. And this solution, this circuit is valid for AAC. In other words, let's suppose just e.g. that you also had a DC source here. Then this circuit here only describes the behavior for the AC source. For the DC source, you have to solve another problem. But that's easy for the DC source. You know that the solution is simply DC source open circuit. So this is DC, this is AC. This gives us the DC solution. This gives us the AC solution. And we can combine the two to get the total solution, the solution for the dc and the ac part. Okay? So let's do a quick example involving, let's say, voltage dividers are current dividers. Let's do a current divider example. Let's suppose you have a source and we have three elements. Let's just start out with two elements and then we'll make it three. So how do I solve this problem? Well, if these were two resistors, R1 and R2, and you're interested, let's say in the current IC, you would just say, well, I c is equal to the admittance of C divided by the witness of C plus the conductance of r, which is g, right? One over r times IS1. It's really that simple, right? Just pretend like these are, these capacitors are just impedances of value one over j Omega C. In fact, it's convenient to just plug in YC and then simplify the solution. So we can simplify the solution by plugging in now, one over j Omega C, one over j Omega C plus g IS1. Let's multiply through by one over j Omega C. We get one plus j omega C times g I S1. So this is the solution. So if I want, if I want to define a transfer function H of j Omega, which is defined as IC divided by IS1. This is the first source, let's say I don't know why I called it IS1 issues call it IS. Okay. So I see there's something wrong. Let me see if I can fix my solution. Yeah. The units are wrong, so I knew I'd made a mistake. So let me multiply through by r. So I get j omega RC one plus j omega RC times IS1. So that's the transfer function, tells you how much of the current at any given frequency flows into the capacitor? Yeah. Question. I can't hear you. Can you say that louder? Yeah. Let me just remind you. Some of you maybe didn't study of current dividers. So let's say this is g1 and g2. Let's say I want to know what I2 is in terms of, IS That's simply G2, g1 plus g2, right? So G here in this problem is just one over r. Other questions. Alright? So whenever you solve a problem like this, what should you do? What are some good things to do to check your solution to make sure you're not completely off. You saw the first thing, which is what I did, I made a mistake and then I noticed the units were wrong. I noticed that the units, you know, IS1 over the transfer function is current over-current. So it should have units of nothing, right? Amps over amps. So if we look at the numerator, what are the units of the numerator? Well, you may recall that RC R times C is a time constant, so that has units of time. Omega has units of frequency, which is one over time. So the numerator doesn't have any units. Good. Denominator, one doesn't have any units. Check. How about the second term? Well, the second term is the same as the numerator. It doesn't have any units, so that checks out. So first check your units. I call these sanity checks. They'll save you when you're on an exam. They'll save you when you're solving a problem in real life. So one is check units. So here we have amps over amps, correct? What's the second thing we can check really easily? Say that louder. Limiting cases, which limits do you want to check? Infinity or zero? Perfect. Let's check the DC solution. So the DC solution should correspond to omega equals zero. So let's look at H of j Omega zero at zero. So the transfer function is this. And if I plug in zero here, I don't need to take any limits or anything. I just plugged it in and I get zero. So does that solution makes sense? So let's redraw the circuit for DC. Notice that at DC, no current flows in the capacitor. And DC steady-state, all the current flows through the resistor. So indeed it checks out. Okay? And the next solution we can check is Omega approaches infinity. So this is very high-frequency. In other words, we want to look at frequencies. Remember, capacitors go like omega one over omega C. So they'd become shorts. Inductors go like omega L, they become opens. So our circuit has a short-circuit which steals all the current away from R. So the transfer function should be one. Okay? Let's check it. Okay? So as omega becomes very large, we can see in the denominator, the second term will dominate over the first term. And then the numerator and the denominator will cancel each other out. And so then the transfer function becomes one and it checks out. So these are always three easy checks that you can do to make sure that your transfer function makes sense, right? You'll catch a lot of errors this way, especially the units one. Okay. Any questions about these checks? Yeah. I just basically the numerator is getting very big and the denominator is also getting very big. And all the terms cancel out, right? J omega c cancels out with j Omega C at really high frequencies. Make sense? Okay? Other questions. Okay. We do the current divider. I'm super superposition. Well, what do I mean by that? Well, let's say we had done the same problem. But let's add a second source. Okay, So we already know the solution for call this H one is j omega RC divided by one plus j omega RC. Already solved that problem. But this is actually kind of tricky because I kinda made a bad example, but it's actually a good example because it does illustrate something. Is this the correct solution for superposition? How many people think it's right? We can reuse it. A one-person. Bravely raised their hand. Okay, he's still holding anyone else? How many people think this is the wrong answer? Okay, I'm gonna call on you. So why is this the wrong answer? Depending on yeah, exactly. So basically, when you turn off, remember in superposition we have to turn off the other source. So in this example, if I turn off the S1, what does it turn into? Short-circuit, right? And so then this transfer function should be zero. Let's say I'm looking at IC. Ic over VS IS x2 is equal to zero. Because the source, the voltage source, takes all the current away. Okay, how about the second transfer function? Well, the second transfer function is the S1. Notice that we've turned off IL-12, so it becomes an open circuit. And we want to find the current through this capacitor. Well, we know the voltage across the capacitor is just v S1. So it's v S1 divided by the impedance, which is one over j Omega C. So the transfer function is very simple. Okay? So be careful source superposition. When you turn off VS, it becomes a short. When you turn off an IS it becomes an open. Okay? Any questions about this example? Because the first transfer function zero, this is the transfer function actually. It's just j omega C times VS. Yeah. Yeah, again, I'll never use the term phasor because I just didn't grow up with the term phasor to me, they're just complex numbers. So yeah, this complex number represents the current, the magnitude and phase of the current, right? Okay. Southern and an ordinal. Let's do another example. Let's say we have a voltage source and we have this R1, C1, R2, C2. And over here we're connecting a load. So Let's say we want to apply Thevenin Theorem, which means we want to take this black box and we want to represent this with basically a Z Thevenin and a V Thevenin. So how do we do this? Exactly the same way we did it before. We V7 and is equal to the open-circuit voltage. Okay? In which case here you can see we have kind of a double voltage divider. And then R Thevenin, which becomes Z Thevenin, is an impedance, which is basically the impedance. Looking into looking blood, say back. In other words, it's this impedance with VS equal to zero. If there are no dependent sources. This is really easy. Let's actually solve Z Thevenin for this particular case. So there's three ways to solve this problem. One is you can connect a current source and observe like we call it a test current source. And then we absorbed the voltage across the current source. Or we apply a voltage source. And we observe the current going through the voltage source, right? Take the ratio or and that's all you need to do that when there's dependent sources. Or you just look at the circuit by inspection, he realized, oh, this is just a combination of series and parallel. And I'm sure you guys have all gotten good at that. Now, all you have to do is redraw this circuit with impedances. Remember the impedance of a resistor is basically the same to the resistance. And we have two capacitors here. Notice that Z Thevenin is simply R1 in parallel with the ZC one. That's this circuit over here, plus R2. And then the whole thing is in parallel with his EC2. That's it. Questions. The voltage source is shorted out, right? Refining the impedance looking in when the voltage sources off to seven in this theorem is actually really easy to prove. Because what you're saying is look, if, if this is the circuit representation, if you ever forget, how does find Z Thevenin V Thevenin, you should just say, well, look, if I wanted to find V Thevenin from this circuit, what is it? It's just the open-circuit voltage. So do the same thing to your black box. Observe the open-circuit voltage, that's V Thevenin. Also, if I wanted to find Z Thevenin for this circuit, I would just turn off my source and look in. And it would be equal to C7 it. So I'll do the same thing with your, with your circuit. Sources are off. Observe Z n, It's equal to Z7. Okay? Now, there's one extra step you have to take here, which is you have to plug in all your j Omega C. So let's just do it for practice and see what we end up with. Well, we end up with is actually important because it's, the form of the solution is going to look the same all the time. So this is R1 in parallel with one over j Omega C one plus R2 in parallel with one over j Omega C2. This is R1, one plus j Omega R1, C1 plus r2 one plus j Omega R1 C1 over the same denominator multiplied by one over j Omega C two divided by this whole thing, plus one over j Omega C2. So let's multiply numerator and denominator by basically these two denominators, one over j Omega C. Let's multiply by j Omega C2. Let's also multiply it by one plus j Omega R1 C1. So on the numerator we get R1 plus R2 one plus j Omega R1 C1. The denominators get cleared out. Here we get R1 plus R2 one plus j Omega R1, C1. This whole thing multiplied by j Omega C2 plus one plus j Omega R1, C1. We're done. So this is the transfer function in a almost an unnormalized form. What I'd like to do is express the transfer function. So Z Thevenin here. Let's think of this as a transfer function, as a numerator and denominator. So in this case, the numerator looks like R1 plus R2 one plus j Omega R1 C1. The denominator is a little more complicated. But when we multiply it out, it's going to give us a second-order in j Omega. So imagine multiplying this out. I don't imagine it. Let's just do it. So here's a linear term. You use a different color. Got a lot of energy today because they played tennis today. I'm sorry if I'm going fast, slow me down if you need to. So here we're gonna get a linear term. And then here we're going to get a quadratic term. When these things multiply out, the denominator can be written as A1 plus A2 j Omega plus a3 j Omega squared. And the numerator can be written as B1 plus B2 j Omega C. So remember last lecture, we talked a little bit about this. We said what these transfer functions are going to have. We're going to always put them in this form, where we have a numerator which is a polynomial of j Omega, and we have a denominator which is also polynomial j Omega. And in this case, polynomials we know fundamental theorem of algebra. The order of the polynomial tells me how many roots the polynomial hats. So the numerator goes to zero, n times where n is the order of the numerator. So in this case the order is one, There's 10 associated with the numerator. So when the numerator is, when we hit it, hit root of the numerator, the whole transfer function goes to zero. Provided the denominator doesn't do something funny. That, that's why we call the roots of the numerator the zeros of the transfer function. We've talked about this last time. So this is a quick review. So roots of n of j Omega. We set n of j Omega equal to zero. We call these the zeros of the transfer function. The roots of the denominator. We call these the poles of transfer function. So let me see if I can make a drawing here. Some kind of tent structure. Okay. Let me just do a simple tent, simple old-fashioned tent that you don't see anymore? Okay. Here's my tent. This is a pole, this is a poll, right? Notice that, and let's say that this is droopy. So of course we can't see these poles are inside. But there's my nice camping tent. So the name poles is actually, you should always think of a tent because a poll pulls the transfer function way up to infinity, right? So if you actually went up to that frequency, you'd be shooting up to infinity. So imagine the poles of a tent. We're infinitely long. As you approach the pole, the transfer function is getting bigger and bigger because the poles are in the denominator. Yes. Can you say that louder? Yeah, I'm just calling Zia transfer function because Z is an impedance and impedance is a transfer function which is voltage over current. Yeah. But what any kind of transfer function you define will have these properties. Now, if you said j Omega, if you solve the second equation, what you're going to find is in the most situations, the poles are complex. So there's not a real frequency omega. Usually there isn't a real frequency omega that makes it blow up. There's a complex frequency. What does that mean? Well, that's something for another class. Okay, take 120. Okay. Alright, so that was a quick overview of all the network theorems that you guys have seen. Don't worry about these poles and zeros. We'll come back to them next lecture, we'll learn to plot transfer functions. Now I want to talk about AC power. So any questions about these examples so far before I go on? Alright, AC power. So let, let's quickly review the passive sign convention. Let's draw capacitors and other examples. So the passive sign convention says, look, if you have current I flowing into an element. Element could be anything. It doesn't have to be a resistor. If it flows into the plus terminal, then this element at any given, at some time t is actually dissipating power. Okay? So you might say, well what's the plus terminal, right? Because most things aren't labeled. And even if they're labeled, there could be labeled wrong. The voltage could be actually inverted. It's okay, It all works out right, because you just pick a terminal. So let's call this the plus terminal. If the current is going in, then it's dissipating power. If you made a mistake and call the other terminal plus, then the current would be going out and you'd get the same result, right? So let me just give you a quick example of why that's true. Let's say I have a voltage source that puts 1 v across a resistor. And let's say I just made a bad choice. In this case, it's very clear where the plus terminal is, right? But let's just suppose that this is a complicated circuit. And you just labeled the plus terminal here. So you have no idea what the actual voltages across this resistor R. So call this v of r. So now I need to look at the current going into here. And I'm going to say the power dissipated by this resistor, the instantaneous power flow into this resistor. I don't know if it's dissipating or not. Of course it is because the resistor is V of R times I of r, where this is I of r. So if this is positive, this implies it's dissipating power. Notice that I screwed up, I mislabeled both. I mislabeled my voltage, which means I also mislabeled the current. So in this case, v of r is -1 v, and the current is minus I. So a minus times a minus gives you a plus. So this just works out to 1 v times I, which is the same thing you would have gotten if you'd label things correctly, right? Quote unquote correctly. So does it matter how you label things? You always get the right answer, right, if you take the current and voltage into account correctly. So let's apply the passive sign convention to a capacitor. For a capacitor, we know that if I labeled plus here, then the current going into here is equal to. C dvdt. And as we observed before, the current can actually be positive or negative, right? If the derivatives, it's the change in voltage that matters. So if the voltage is increasing, then the current is positive. So it looks like it's dissipating power, right? Because they're both have a positive sign, right? So if d v, d t is bigger than zero, and v, of course, let's say, let's just say that V happens to be positive and its derivative is positive. This implies that i c times VC. Guess I just call it IV. So let me not put it in subscripts. I of t, v of t is equal to p of t is greater than zero. But by the passive sign convention that implies that the capacitor is dissipating energy. Where's the energy going? The resistor, It's clear. Put your hand on it. It's getting hot. You're converting electrical energy into thermal energy. Or the resistor. It could be modeling a light bulb, in which case some of the energy is being converted into light. But for a capacitor, where is that energy going? Yeah, in the back. Exactly. It's going into the capacitor as being stored. It's not being dissipated because as long as dvdt is positive, it's storing energy. But the moment dvdt becomes negative, it's giving you energy back. So when dvdt flip sign and goes to a negative value, then P of t equals I of t, v of t will be less than zero because this is still positive. And this now becomes negative. So this means that now it's actually supplying energy. So this means that it's supplying energy is acting like an energy source or voltage source, as the passive sign convention tells us. So that's a quick review of power. Slow. Let's apply this to AC circuits. Alright? So we have a general element here. We'll just call it z. And we know that for a general element in harmonic steady state, There's gonna be a sinusoidal voltage across it. And there's gonna be a sinusoidal current flowing through it. And z, which is the impedance, tells us of the relationship between the voltage and the current. The voltage and current. So in sinusoidal steady-state, let's say the voltage is some v zero cosine omega t. Then we know that the current is also going to be sinusoidal. And it's going to have some phase shift with respect to the voltage. How do I know what is i zero and what is Fi? Any takers? Yeah. The impedance Z, yeah. So what do we need to look at? So give me an answer for what is zero in terms of these zeros. Okay. It's not a trick question. Yeah. Anyone else? Are you you're onto the right track, so just finish up the thought. You're almost there. He's going to steal it away from you. Alright? You raise your hand first yet. Over one of z. Z is a complex number, right? These are real voltage waveforms. Magnitude of z great. So I zero is simply v zero divided by the magnitude of Z. What's feet? Any takers? What's the phase of the current waveform with respect to the voltage? A good review problem, right? Who saw this on the exam? This is like easy points, brownie points, you get it. No problem. Yeah. Over the angle of z naught. But you're getting there. Anyone else? So phase is, it's basically it's something 0-2 pi, right? Or some number 0-360, angle of z, close, but no cigar, full points, you don't get full marks. Who wants phone book and get full marks? Really making you guys think because this is a very simple problem. And if you understand this problem, then you can say, okay, I understand AC circuits because it's so simple. And yet you guys are struggling, right? Or maybe you're just shy. And we've got something that's very close. The angle of z or the phase of z. Yeah. Let's not go there. Just tell me what is it in terms of so he's very close. He said It's the angle of z. Anybody? He's very close. So you're just missing one little thing. Plus pi by two? No. Yeah. Yeah, it's the negative angle of z because it's on the denominator. That's it. That's all. If you understand this slide, you understand AC circuits, okay? Alright, so now let's multiply out V and I. That gives us the instantaneous power. And so for V zero, I have cosine Omega t. And then for I zero, I'm going to use a trig identity, which you may remember or maybe you don't. Which looks like that. Basically this is cosine a plus cosine. Let's say cosine a plus B is cosine a, cosine B minus sine a sine B. Now let's collect terms I have V zero is zero cosine Phi cosine squared omega t minus v zero sine Phi cosine omega t, sine omega t. Ok? Simple algebra. Notice that these are just constants here. This is a constant. And this is a constant. And this is actually the instantaneous power flow in any AC circuit. In steady-state, sinusoidal steady-state, we have a term that's proportional to cosine squared, and we have a term proportional to sine times cosine. Okay? So this is instantaneous power flow. It's going positive, it's negative. What are we usually interested in? Usually interests, right? How much work we have to do or how much money we have to pay, right? If power is flowing into your house, you get charged for when your microwave isn't, right? Or when your Internet routers routing packets. So we're interested in not the instantaneous power flow, but what's the average power flow, right? So how do we get the average? Of course, that gives us the energy. So to get the energy or the average power flow, we're going to just average P of T over one cycle. And basically divide by t. T is equal to one cycle of cosine omega t. So omega is two pi over t. So if we substitute for P average, this expression, let me be lazy and not do any math. Let me observe the second term first. For the second term. What happens when you average a sine times a cosine? If you've done it once, you'll never forget. Yeah. Alright, Well, it sounds like people haven't done this calculation before, so let me just use a couple of trig identities, which will help me out. Sine times cosine is actually sine of two omega t. And cosine squared is one and there might be a factor of two in there. Cosine two omega t divided by two. Factor of two won't matter because if I integrate, remember that everything in front of that sine two omega t is a constant. So if I integrate that over a cycle, what happens if you integrate sine of omega t over one period of omega? It's going twice as fast, right? But it still averages to zero. So here's a picture. Here's sine Omega t. And then here we're saying that this guy is doing this. So clearly this part and this part will cancel. This part and this part will cancel even though my picture, they, they certainly do not cancel it, but they would. So the integral of sine two omega t d t from zero to t is a big fat zero. Great. I liked zeros, right? They make life easier. You don't have to remember the constants. Second term is gone, right? For the average power. The first term is actually, you see that there's the one-half cosine two omega t is really just the same as signed two omega t rice is phase shifted by 90 degrees. So integrating that over a cycle also gives me zero. So the only person that survives this integration is that factor of one-half, right? This is the only term that survives. So we can say that this integral, the lazy man's solution we found, is just one-half times v zero. I is zero times one-half. T. T's cancel out. And this half is yeah, This this already. Why did I put the half there? Half is here. I forgot the cosine phi term. So the solution, the t's cancel out is one-half v zero I is zero cosine feet. This is the average power dissipated by impedance Z. Just write that out. Average power dissipated by z. Let's do some sanity checks. Z could be anything, it could be a resistor, it can be an inductor, it could be a capacitor. Let's start out with a resistor. So we have an equation that says the average power is one-half I zero cosine feet. What's fee for a resistor? Anybody? Zero, right? Because resistors have no memory, they do not introduce any phase shift in the circuit, right? So the average power is one-half I zero. But we know that we could write V zero is zero r. Then we get an OH over here and we get this expression which is one-half I zero squared R. Anybody bothered by this X final answer? Yeah, someone is. Yeah. Why are you bothered by it? Yeah. I squared R is only true for DC. For AC, you get a different answer. Why is that? Well, just to introduce some notation to you guys. Sometimes some people don't like factors of 1.5. And they just say, Well, let's just call this I RMS squared times r, where I RMS is defined as the amplitude over square root of two. Okay, and in fact, I can rewrite this expression. Maybe over here I have RMS. I can say that the average power, which is one-half v cosine phi phi, again, don't like factors of one-half. I can say that this is V RMS I RMS cosine fee. Where V RMS is defined as V over root two. I RMS is defined as we already defined it, iss over root two. So we multiply them together, they produce a factor of one-half. Okay? What is RMS? Rms root mean squared. Alright, and we'll actually come back and see where this, why we call this the root mean squared. But this is actually something that maybe you weren't even aware of. So what's the voltage? What's the amplitude of the voltage coming into your typical outlet, right? Go and hook up an acyl scope on a typical outlet, what voltage or you're going to see. What's that? Are you saying 121, 20 v? Nope. Anybody else? Okay. You've been lead your whole life to believe it is one-twenty. It's one 20 v RMS. People didn't bother to tell you that it's RMS. So all the voltages and AC, you have to, it's really a pain. Anytime someone says 300 millivolts and you're talking about AC, you have to say RMS. No, no, not RMS amplitude. Then if they're designing circuits, you have to say zero to peak or peak to peak. And then when they answer that question, you know, zero to peak, differential or single ended. That stuff you can worry about later. But basically, for now, when someone says AC voltage of 50 v, you have to say 50 v RMS or 50 v amplitude. Okay? So that's where the vast factors of square root of two come from. And in some textbooks you might even find people sneaking in these factors of square root of two into definitions of phasors themselves. I don't do that. I actually don't factor of one-half doesn't bother me. So I don't use RMS personally, but you guys will see RMS being used. Let me just quickly tell you the origin of the term RMS. So imagine integrating something over a cycle. So let's say it's a resistor. Just go back to time domain. Let's substitute do i. I of t times r times I of t is i of t squared times R. And let me take the average power, just like before. The art comes out. And let me define I RMS as the square root of this term. So that then this could be written as i RMS square times R. So now you see it. Root Mean Squared. There's the squared, There's the mean, there's the root. This is useful because we did this calculation for a sinusoid. In sinusoid, we found that it's square root of 1/2. But you can also do the calculation for a square wave. For triangular wave or any wave form, some noisy waveform, right? Some voice audio signal, whatever. You can always find the root mean squared and define the power flow as I squared R. So this is people's attempts, it kinda making a general statement and making that I squared R term universally true. I squared R is always the power dissipated if I is actually the RMS power in question. Any questions about that? Okay. How do we write this in terms of phasors? You might be saying, well, maybe power is simply V times I, where these are phasors. I'll just put a little mark here. But we can already see that this is actually can't be correct, right? This, if you think about phasors, multiplying them together, doesn't give you one-half V zero. Cosine phi. What, what can I do to phasors so that I actually get this product? Well, let's look at what happens when we multiply the times I conjugate. So this is v zero. We actually used, we define the phase of I as just being equal to redefine fee as the phase relative to v, So that would just be v zero. Let me actually generalize this equation a little bit so that I can notice that this phase is the relationship between I and V. So in this example, that calculation that I did, I just set the phase of the voltage to be equal to zero. And then I set the current. So this phi is the phase of the current relative to the voltage. But the phase of the voltage doesn't necessarily have to be zero, right? It could be anything. I could redo this calculation and do the same thing for the numerator for the first term as the second term, right? Call it Fi, V and VI. Do the calculations at the end of the day. What you would end up with is cosine minus phi. So this is really what the fee that we were talking about is. Does that make sense? Any questions? I want to make sure that you guys digest that. Yeah. Yes. So let me draw some pictures here. Let's say this is our voltage waveform, right? And steady-state. And on, of course, on a different scale, This is our current waveform. What we're saying is what matters is the phase difference between the voltage and the current that determines the average power. The actual absolute phase, one or the other is immaterial. And the minus sign comes about because it's the phase difference that matters. Before I actually go to this phasor form. Let's do some examples to make sure we understand this. Let's look at the power flow in a capacitor. So in terms of phasors, of course, I is equal to j omega C times V. That means that in terms of time domain, this factor of j is a 90 degree phase shift, right? So the magnitude of z is 90 degrees. So the current, it has a 90 degree phase shift from the voltage. So if this is the voltage waveform in steady-state, the current waveform looks like that. So it's the product. Instantly in steady-state, It's the instantaneous product of voltage times current that tells you the power dissipated. So let's, let's focus in on one period of the cycle. So I'll just pick this interval, right? It doesn't matter which interval you pick. It's arbitrary. But let's just look at this interval and see what's happening in this part of the waveform. You can see that both, up until here, both waveforms are positive. So this will integrate and give us a positive number. Likewise, in this part of the cycle, actually not. Likewise in this part of the cycle, It's called this, the voltage has called this the current. The voltage is positive, but the current is negative. So we get a negative bump. This third line here is the power being dissipated. Now, if you look at the voltage waveforms, they're perfectly symmetric between that first quarter cycle and the second quarter cycle right there. Just the only difference. Of course, the voltage is definitely the same, right? You go from a peak. If you go right or left, the voltage looks the same as exact same waveform shape. And all we care about is the integral. So it doesn't matter which order it takes. The current waveform is that minus shape, right? So it's an odd symmetric function about that vertical line, this line here. So with respect to this line, we can see that the current waveform is odd because here it's positive, here it goes negative. The voltage is even, has the same shape on both sides, both positive. So this integral exactly cancels out that integral. Okay? Let's continue looking at this. Alright, so now let's go to another quarter cycle. Just here. Here the current waveform is negative, the voltage waveform is also negative. So this gives us a positive contribution. Notice that it looks something like a cosine squared. So it doesn't have the sharp wave form and it starts out at zero. And then it has like this parabolic part over here due to the cosine squared. Over here, the current is positive, but the voltage is negative. So it does that. And again, when we do this, averaging, get rid of this stuff. We can clearly see that this cancels with this, and this cancels with this. So the average is zero. Why is it zero? Remember this is the average power dissipated by an impedance. The impedance we happen to pick here was a capacitor. How much power does a capacitor dissipates zero? So the answer is exactly right. Better than be zero, otherwise we made a mistake. Now, it's interesting how it, it turns out to be zero because instantaneously the capacitor is not involved in power flow. It's actually very involved one-quarter of the cycle, right? The first quarter of the cycle, it's actually saying, Okay, give me energy. I'm storing it. The second quarter cycle, it gives it back to you. Then the process repeats. So twice per cycle, the capacitor is absorbing energy and twice per cycle it's giving it back. So from a power flow perspective, the capacitor is very important and we give it a name, we call it reactive power. I think I have that somewhere written down. Yeah. So capacitors and inductors, they don't dissipate power, but they store power. And from a power perspective, the energy they store is actually really important. They do some amazing things because they store energy, will see that hopefully by the end of today's lecture. Okay? So even though when we average the power, we get zero, it seems like we should take into account this extra power, right? So the reactive power, when we look at p of t, We've gotten 1.5 V zero is zero cosine of Phi cosine. So this is the average power. And it was going at a rate of it was modulating at this rate of cosine two omega t. And then the other factor, which goes like sign of Fi, goes like sine of two omega t. So if we look at this second term here, this one is the one that averages to zero. We'll call this reactive power. The reactive power is a function of time. It always averages to zero over a cycle, but it modulates at twice the frequency, twice the frequency. And it actually has a relationship that's like sine of phi, where phi is the phase difference between the voltage and the current. So for instance, how much reactive power does a resistor half? There's a resistor store energy. No, should be zero. Sine of Phi for a resistor, the voltage and current are in phase. Fee is zero, sine of Pi is zero. Yes, resistors don't store reactive energy. What kinds of elements store the most reactive energy? What should Phoebe to maximize the reactive energy? More than one solution? Yeah. How about another solution? Well, how about a half cycle? Minus nine degrees, right? Plus or minus nine degrees maximize the reactive energy storage. Reactive power. And interestingly, a plus 90 degrees stores power. When a -90 degrees dissipates. In other words, a capacitor as storing energy. When an inductor is dissipating energy exactly in the opposite phase. Because right, if we go plus or -90, the sign flips science. So if we had two components and there are driven by the exact same voltage waveform. Or if they're driven in series with the exact current waveform. If I take a capacitor and inductor, then it's possible for them to store at least phase unwise. When one is storing energy, the other one is dissipating energy. Not necessarily the same amount in general. But something magical happens when they store and dissipate the same amount of energy. That's actually what happens in resonance. That's something that we're going to talk about later. Very exciting. But this is the origin of resonance. The origin of residence is when energy stored in capacitors is exactly dissipated by the inductors and vice versa. When the energy stored in the inductors, the capacitors are dissipating energy. And if their energies are equal, they can just exchange energies with each other and leave the rest of the circuit alone. In resonance circuits become much simpler. Okay? So I want to get to this interesting example. And so I'm going to talk about the maximum power transfer theorem and then we'll look at our practical example. So what is the maximum power transfer theorem? And why is it useful? Let's say you have a voltage source with some source impedance is E-S. Okay? I need to go back and finish this phasor form. Okay, so before we do that example, Let's just write that. Let's come up with an expression for the power in terms of phasors. Okay? And so what I'm going to show you is that look, if I define it in the following way, where V is a phasor and i is a phasor. My claim is that if you take the real part of this, I'll call this the phasor power. This is the actual average power. Okay? So why is that true? Well, I conjugate is basically I with the phase shifted, right? So let me write I as, let's say that I is some eyes zero e to the j phi. So I conjugate is simply i zero e to the j phi with a minus sign. And if I plug in what v is, v is v e to the j v v. Notice that if I collect terms here, I get F0 v minus phi, which I defined as phi. This is the phase difference between the voltage and the current. If I take the real part of this, I get one-half v cosine phi. That's exactly what we found earlier. So we can directly go to average power with phasors by taking V times I conjugate. You might say, well, why did you pick on I? Let's pick on V. We can do the same thing because f0 is an even function. It doesn't care if I had defined. The average power as V times instead of I conjugate, I'm going to take the conjugate. Notice that I get the same exact thing. I get e to the minus j vv, v zero I is zero, e to the j phi divided by two, which is one-half v0e to the j phi minus VV. If I take the real part, I get one-half rho cosine Phi minus VB. But that of course is equal to one-half V zero cosine feet V minus VI, which is F0, talks the same thing. Fact. I can take both of them. I can say that the average power is V i. These are phasors plus eyes. I conjugate V divided by two. And then I take the real part. Okay? So why is that useful? You might be wondering, well, let me give you an example. So let's say again we have some impedance Z. Notice now I'm not going to draw rectangles anymore. I just draw some impedance Z as if it were a resistor. Ok, you'll see that it's very common. So if I want to find the average power, I'm going to take I times V divided by to make sure I put a conjugate here. And so I know that in a circuit, if there's a voltage V across here, and this is an impedance, the current is simply V over z. So this gives me v squared over two z. Remember I need the real part. So I'm going to write this. I'm going to multiply numerator and denominator by z conjugate. And then I'm going to take out everything that is not complex anymore. So V squared is no longer complex. Z-squared is no longer complex, and I'm left with the real part of z conjugate. But of course the real part of z conjugate is the same as the real part of z. So I'll just erase the conjugate. So this is telling you that the average power dissipated for an impedance is magnitude v squared over the magnitude of z squared divided by the magnitude of a times the real part of z. Well, does this checkout with what we learned earlier for an inductor or capacitor. What's the real part of z? Zero? Which tells us the average power dissipated zero, which is what we expected. Okay, so now what I want to do is go back to this example and ask you guys, what is the best load to connect in order to extract the maximum possible power from the source. So before we solve this problem, Let's solve the DC equivalent. How many people have seen this problem before from 16 a or another class? You guys know the solution. Well, it's actually a very important problem, right? Like let's give an example. Let's talk about solar panel, right? Let's say somebody tells you that I have a solar panel and it has two wires coming out. From the perspective of, you know, you want to get, you know, you've got solar radiation incident here. This generates a voltage and I'm going to hook up my load, which is my house. So the question is, what's the best house to design for a given solar panel, right? In other words, what's the best load I could connect in order to extract the maximum power from my solar panel. Well, we could say that the solar panel, no matter what it's made of at the end of the day, what does it look like? What's a good theorem to use? What's that? Thevenin, yeah, let's use Thevenin. This is the open-circuit voltage of my solar panel. And this is some R Thevenin. So the question is, what should my house look like in order to extract the maximum power? Now you see it's a very important question. For instance, if my house were an open-circuit, how much power would I be extracting? Zero, right? It'd be no current flowing. What if my, if my house where a short-circuit, how much power would I be extracting? Likewise, zero, there'd be current flowing. That solar panel would be doing work. But your house doesn't have any voltage across it, so it can't do any work, right? Power is V times I. We need to maximize the product of V times I. So let's, let's write equation and say that the power going into your house is V times I is a DC problem. So we don't need to worry about phasors. We can say, well, this is equal to the times V over R, right? This is our house. Or we could write this as I squared R house. It turns out that the optimum is equal to R Thevenin. This is called a power match. When you match, when you provide a match here, you extract the most power from the source. How do we get this? Well, you basically take the derivative of the house power with respect to r and set it equal to zero. So in this circuit, i is a function of r. Because I is V Thevenin divided by R Thevenin plus R H. For short. Let me just call this RH because I'm lazy. Erasing is easier than writing times r h. So we need to take this derivative, set it equal to zero, we solve. And I'm short on time. And you'll find that the maximum occurs interestingly enough, for a match. So you can actually go to your house and measure R Thevenin and figure out what's the best load to connect. And there'll be very different from your microwave oven, right? Because when it needs to power the microwave oven, that's too much power can, it can't do it. The voltage will just collapse because it will have too much current flowing. So there will be an optimum load. And so if you imagine designing some kind of like battery energy storage, you'd make your battery always look like R Thevenin. So you're maximizing, maximizing the power that you're extracting from the solar panel. And then you could store that energy and convert it to other voltages needed by different instruments in your house, right? So the optimum voltage is not 120 v or wherever V Thevenin over two. Because when you match, you can half of the voltage, it's at the start. It's a little counter-intuitive that half voltage is the optimum. But the half voltage maximizes the product of the current and the voltage. So when we look at the power going into the house versus our house, we know that for our house equal to zero, we extract no power. We also know that for infinity we extract no power. And it turns out that it's a simple peak when our house is equal to R Thevenin. Alright? Now we want to generalize this to impedances. And of course we're out of time. But I'll set up the problem for you guys and then we'll solve it very quickly next time. So we want to take v times i conjugate. And we want to take the derivative with respect to x L equal to zero. And with respect to RL, set it equal to zero. We'll basically write ZL as RL plus j X L. And so we have two equations, two unknowns and we solve. Now we already know what the solution has to be for the real part, right? Because if the imaginary parts is zero, from the maximum power transfer theorem for resistive circuits, we know what RL should be, what should be. It should be the real part of z. S has to be right if you solve the simple case without impedances and you get a match, this better, give you the same answer. If you said impedance is equal two resistors. What about XL? Well, it turns out that the solution encourage you guys to solve this on your own, is the minus of the imaginary part of z S. And this, for obvious reasons, is called the conjugate match. Because you're not matching the impedance. Your conjugate matching it. You're making the real parts equal. You're making the imaginary parts minus of each other or complex conjugate. Okay? So this conjugate match gives you the maximum power transfer in an AC circuit. And you might be wondering, well, what's the application of this? Well, the applications of this are huge. For instance, if you're designing a radio and it's hooked up to an antenna, and the signal that you're picking up, it's very weak. It's usually the case, right? Because the transmitters far away. So it's very important to extract the maximum power you can from the antenna. Turns out, you can look into the antenna, figure out what is the Southern equivalent is it's some impedance plus a voltage source, a very, very tiny voltage source. And then you, you basically load it with complex conjugate. Load, a conjugate match load to extract the maximum power. You don't want to waste any power because the signal is so small. The example that we'll look at next lecture is RFID. Same exact principle. Rfid, right? You don't want to, you know, you don't want to have to tick you. You want to be able to put your RFID a little distance away from the reader and have it still work. So we're going to find is the RFID problem. We're going to analyze it. We're going to find that again. Impedance-matching gives us boost the voltage considerably over the case where we don't match. And that's again, the reason for that is going to be resonance. And we'll talk about that next time. Alright, see you then.
