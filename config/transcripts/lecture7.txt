Yeah. All right. Okay, I'll get started. So I want to finish up some material from last lecture and give you guys hopefully a little bit more intuition on second-order circuits. In office hours. A few people mentioned that it was kinda, kinda daunting to solve these problems with all these new symbols, q, Zeta, all that stuff. So let's go through it again very quickly. And then we're going to actually slow down and carefully look at why the solutions look like this. So as you'll recall last lecture, we showed that when you have a LTR circuit, it turns out to be a second-order differential equation. And we put in e to the st, just like before we see, we said for the homogeneous solution, Let's try e to the st. And we plug that in and we ended up with a, basically an algebraic equation. Write a quadratic equation, which we can solve and has two roots. It's a quadratic equation, has two roots. And those two roots in general could be real, they could be imaginary, right? In general, they're complex. So what we found was that there's a couple of parameters that we can define which tell us what kind of roots we have. We basically found that there was a scaling factor associated with the roots. That's the product of L and C, that's tau in these equations. Let me remind you of the equation that we found. We found that for our second-order circuit, we have a term S t tau squared plus a term S T two zeta plus one is equal to zero. So there is this scaling coefficient, if you will. Which we can just absorb into our variable. We can solve this equation and then whatever solution we get, we scale it by one over tau. And tau is actually a really important number. It has units of time. And it's actually related to the frequency, sometimes called the oscillation frequency, the natural frequency of this circuit. Omega naught squared is one over LC. If we go back to our equation, we can match coefficients and find that this scaling just tells us how it's kind of a time scaling factor. When you're drawing these plots, you can normalize the x-axis by t over Tau. Notice that I did that over here. And now I can draw a kind of normalized solutions with respect to time. So this is kind of a scaled version of timer or a normalized version of time. So that means that the only remaining parameter is zeta, right? And when you solve the quadratic equation, we found zeta under the root. We found a term like this, which determines the character of the solution, right? If zeta is bigger than one, the roots are real. Square root of a positive number gives us two real roots. If zeta is equal to one, then we have two repeated roots. Which means we had to solve, we had to come up with a second solution. And finally, if zeta is less than one, we found that the roots become complex. That means we have an exponential of a complex argument. And we've met that, those kinds of functions before. We know that an exponential of a complex argument has two parts. An exponential of an imaginary exponent just spins around the circle at a rate proportional to one over tau or Omega. So Omega tells us how fast is that exponential spinning around the circle. And the real part of that root tells you, if it's positive, basically if the real part is negative, it's telling you how fast does this solution decay towards zero. Okay? Now, that's a lot to remember. And somebody in office hours ask like, should we be solving every second-order problem by putting it into the standard form and solving it. And I think the answer is usually no, because this is the theory we want it to kind of establish the types of solutions that you have. So we went through this detailed calculation, we identified some parameters of interest. But if you're just solving a problem, you can just have numbers, right? It's 5 Ï‰ and 50 Pico farads. You don't have to set it up to make it look like this. You could just solve the problem. You could take your system, find the roots of your system, and you know the solution, right? You don't need to kinda do this pattern matching to this. This is for theory, theoretical understanding for generalization of what you've learned. Nevertheless, this zeta parameters, very interesting, right? It's telling us something. What do you guys think? It's telling us? Intuitively? What is zeta telling us? Well, let's look at these plots. If we just had to guess. We can see that for zeta, that's large, things are a little bit boring, right? It just looks like a normal RC circuit. It just settles. On the other hand, when zeta is small, in fact, I can make it really small. I find that the solution does crazy things like that. It oscillates, it takes a long time to settle. In fact, what happens if zeta is equal to one at zero? Well, let's go back and look at what, you know, in our series circuit. What was zeta? I'm going back and saying, okay, so zeta is given by WHO? Way back here, 1/2 Q. Actually, let's use this definition. It's basically one half R times C. So one-half R times C. Okay, Sorry about the whiplash. If this is equal to zero, then we have two situations. Either there's no capacitor in the circuit, or there's no resistor in the circuit, right? R is equal to zero. So let's take R is equal to zero. So then what is our circuit look like? You know, the one that we were solving. We have a power supply connected with a switch. And initially we're assuming the capacitor is discharged, there's no current. And then we close the switch. So if what we're finding now is that if, if there's no resistance in the circuit, the solution looks like this. It just oscillates with constant amplitude. So once we introduce that resistor, with a resistor, it's doing something like this. So what's going on with that resistor? And so we want to get a little more insight into what role this resistor is playing. Okay? So we're going to switch gears and talk about energy. We're going to say how much energy is stored in the tank, right? We have an L, a, C, and an R. Resistors don't store any energy, right? They just dissipate energy. So energy is stored in the capacitance and inductance, right? The energy stored in the capacitance we derived almost, I think there's a first or second lecture is one-half CV squared. But of course V is varying now, but at any instantaneous time, if we ask how much energy is on the capacitor, it's one-half CV squared. How much energy is in the inductor. We also derive that for an inductor, there's an analogous equation. It's one-half LI squared. Again, we derive that for like charging up an inductor a certain current. Now the current is varying. So we can say that instantaneously as the current varies, the energy stored is one-half LI squared. Notice that it's I squared and V squared, the capacitor and the inductor. They don't care about which direction the current or voltage is. They still store energy, right? If you take a capacitor and you charge it positive, it's storing a lot of energy. Now charged it negatively. Is it storing any less energy? No, right. The capacitor doesn't care about which plate is higher than the other plate. Similar with an inductor. An inductor stores energy due to the momentum it has. So if the current is going in one direction and generating a magnetic field, that's a lot of energy, right? If, if it's a big inductor, now you switch the current direction around that's still storing the same amount of energy as long as the magnitude of the current is the same. So that's why it's v squared and I squared. So if we use our equations, we're going to start out with a lossless case. For in the lossless case, r is equal to zero. We found, if we go back to our equations that in the lossless case, the current and the voltage are just varying sinusoidally. Write the solution is just the complex exponential plus the conjugate of that. Let me go back and remind you of that. So this is the solution that we found for the under-damped case. Certainly the case where gamma is equal to zero is this solution. Here. If zeta is equal to zero, we can see that this damping factor goes away. So let's take this solution. And notice that under the conditions that zeta is equal to zero, this term goes away. Then we're just left with a sinusoidal oscillation. And so this is what we have here. So we're saying the current is some magnitude cosine omega t. Remember Omega zero is the repetition frequency of that complex exponential. If we look at the plot of the voltage and current, It's the rate at which we have zero crossings to zero crossing, great. And the zero crossing rate is exactly omega naught. When we have damping, it's slightly different. It's omega naught times square root of one minus zeta squared. Theta is very small. We're almost going at the natural frequency. Okay? Likewise, if we basically want to find the voltage on the capacitor, the current. Here's the circuit again, just to remind you. So this is I and this same INR is flowing into the capacitor. And so to find the voltage across the capacitor, we can just integrate the current. And since it's sinusoidal, if you integrate a cosine, you got to sign with a one over omega popping out. And so this is what we get over here. Since it's squared, it becomes omega squared sine squared. Okay? Any questions? Yes. Yeah, I M is the magnitude of the current. So we're saying that the eye has some magnitude. Cosine omega naught t. This is the current through the circuit. Any other questions, clarifying questions? Yeah. So yeah, omega represents this zero crossing rate. So this period, this is t is one over omega. Okay? And times two pi omega represents how long does it take to accumulate two pi radians of phase. So if you divide omega by two pi. And you get some number, let's say 50. That's 50 hz, meaning that you're repeating 50 times a second. If it's 1,000, it means you're repeating 1,000 times a second. So omega is how often does this thing, how fast does this thing oscillate? Basically the zero crossing rate. Okay, Good question. Other questions, clarifying questions. Yeah. The sea, which C? This capacitance C term here? No, because it gets squared. Yeah, Good point. No, actually it's getting squared so it doesn't cancel. But yeah, good day. Alright. Okay, so now we have the energy for the inductor. At this point, it just some garbage times cosine omega squared. And we have the energy on the capacitor. Some more terms times sine squared. Okay? So let's just sum them together to find the total energy in the tank at any given time, right? So if I sum these two terms together, let me pull out my common factors. They both have a factor of one-half I M squared. And one is cosine squared minus sine squared. And basically this one has a factor of L. This one has a factor of one over C times omega naught squared. But Omega naught squared is in fact one over LC, which means these two factors are the same. So if I take c is equal to one over omega naught L squared. You can see that this term, let me put c over here and l over here. This term is simply L, which means that I can pull that out, out as well. And sine squared plus cosine squared is just one, right? Great. I get a constant. I get that the energy in the tank is a constant. One-half L I M squared. I M is the peak current through the inductor. Okay? Is this result expected? Well, if the energy, if the tank is lossless, right, there's no resistance. Where else would the energy goat, right? So if the inductor storing energy, some energy at a given time, and let's say the capacitor is not storing any energy. And we find that the energy on the inductor is going down because the current is going down, right? Current is cosine, so peak value is IM, it even will cross zero. So at some point, the current in the circuit is going to go to zero. That means the inductor at that point is not storing energy. So where did that energy go? Conservation of energy says that, hey, you can't destroy energy, it must be somewhere else. Where is it residing? It's all going into the capacitor exactly. Again, mechanical analogies are very useful. In this case, it's exact same differential equation. Maybe you've even seen these equations in your physics class. This is C, this is l, this is the mass m, This is some spring constant k. This is oscillating up and down sinusoidally. And there's kinetic energy. And there is potential energy being stored in the spring. And the sum of these energies is constant. Same exact differential equations, same exact solution, same exact analogy. I was having a discussion with my son. He he actually it's his birthday today, just turned 12. And a couple of weekends ago where at the park and he's on the swing. And he likes me to take slow motion pictures of him while he's basically jumping off the swing and going into the air, right? It looks cool. So we're trying to debate like what's the best time to jump off the swing, right? Because if you wait too long and the swing goes all the way to the top, how much speed, What's your speed? Zero, right? So that's the worst time to jump off. It's going to look really lame. On the other hand, if you jump right in the middle, what's your speed right in the middle? It's a maximum, right? So that would seem to be the best time to jump, but you're really low, right? So we're trying to find what's the best place to jump off where you have, so you get some height and you get some distance. Same exact situation here. So this circuit is exchanging energy between this inductor and capacitor. The inductor represents the momentum of the circuit. The capacitor represents the storage of energy in the tank. Okay, So that's cool. What about the case where you have loss? Well, the loss, we know resistors lose energy. Simply drew by Joule heating one-half I squared R, right? So they are also depends, doesn't care about the direction of the current. If current is going through a resistor, it, you're going to lose energy. And the amount of power that you lose is one-half I squared R. And here we have a current, let's say a peak current of I am. So at this, let's say at this moment in time, there's a current I am going, this is the time at which the inductor is storing its peak energy. Then if we were to multiply this by the time the period, remember the period is the time between the zero crossings or the time between the peaks. That's two pi over omega. So rough, roughly if a system has low loss, we can say that this is roughly the amount of energy that you dissipate per cycle. It's not exact because the current is actually varying. We'd have to integrate over a cycle, right, to find the average energy. But yeah, just doing a back of the envelope calculation, we can say it's one-half I squared R times t. Later on we'll actually do the more exact calculation with, and we'll call this RMS and we'll do that later. But for now, just want to give you an idea of what these parameters mean. So now, if we take the amount of energy that's stored in the system, the peak energy stored in the system is one-half LI squared. And we just found that the energy dissipated per cycle is also related to I squared. So all these ice squareds cancel out. Factors of a half cancel out. And we end up with an interesting ratio here, which is omega naught L over R times two Pi. Now remember that zeta was defined as one-half RC. Let me write this as. Remember, I know that Omega naught squared is one over LC. So c is equal to one over L Omega naught squared. So I'm going to plug in here, R times C, which is R over L over omega naught squared. And over here, I found Omega naught over l. So this is one-half r Omega naught L times one over omega naught. So going back to this equation, we have this factor of omega naught here. And it cancels out one of the extra factors of omega naught here, which gives us this ratio, omega naught L over R, which we're going to call Q. And basically, Q is very widely used term. It's called the quality factor of the tank. And it tells you it's a ratio of how much energy is being stored in the tank, divided by the peak energy stored in the tank, divided by the energy lost per cycle, right? We took the power loss, multiplied it by period to get kinda like the average power loss in a cycle. This Q factor, of course, is also related to zeta, as we saw, this is 1/2 zeta. And now we can see that we can interpret Zeta parameter as basically inversely proportional to q, meaning that the larger zeta is, right, the smaller the Q of the circuit, meaning the more power you lose per cycle. So it's like setting somebody in motion on a swing where there's a lot of friction. And so they're only going to oscillate a few cycles and then stop. That's a lo que swing, right? Any kid would tell you that is low. Q. The other hand, a. High Q. Swing is one where you set someone in emotion and then you can just go read your e-mail and your kid is gonna be on the swing, happy going back-and-forth, right? That's a high IQ swing. So it's a ratio of how much energy is stored divided by the amount of energy or losing per cycle. So one way to again back of the envelope, see this is to say again, this is back of the envelope, but it's really useful. If you see, like if I, let's say I charge up this capacitor with 1 v and observe v over time. Then we're going to see something like this, right? You're going to, of course, there's an infinite number of cycles, but the amplitude is getting smaller and smaller. If you were to count the number of cycles that have significant amplitude, you might say, well, yeah, you know the first cycle, second cycle, third cycle, maybe there's five or six cycles before this thing has just gone because it's exponential, right? So five cycles means that in five cycles I lost all the energy stored in the system. So again, going back to this definition, definition of Q, again, this is all hand-wavy. But it's good intuition tells us that if you see five cycles, that means that per cycle you're losing about 20% of your energy. Which means your q is roughly about five, right? Because in five cycles all the energy is gone. It wouldn't be linear. It would it be linear? They wouldn't be 20%. No, it's not exactly linear because the amplitude is going down. So you energy stored is going down. But remember, actually, I take that back. If we look at the, the power loss, right? And the power store, the power stored at any given time is one-half LI peak, let's say squared. Alright? And the power lost is one-half I peak squared times R. I'm going to just put in a correction factor here alpha. Later on we'll, we'll do a more careful calculation. Because even though the peak amplitude is going down, the peak loss also track. So when I take the ratio, it cancels out. So every cycle you're roughly losing the same amount of energy. Okay. Good question. Yeah. That is one case, right? That's one example. Yeah. So the question is I'll repeat for those who didn't hear, like, what is this situation where you charge up a capacitor, let's say with a battery and then disconnect. Well, all these problems are related, right? The homogeneous solution is the same for all of these. It's just the boundary, the initial conditions to determine those constants, right? So in this case, if I initially charged this capacitor and then Let's say connected to ground. What's going to happen? So that basically I'm going to charge up this capacitor with some energy and then it's going to swing, right. But any circuit involving LLCs and ours, I guess I should draw an arc here because I have a decaying wave form. Any circuit involving LLCs and ours is going to have this characteristics solution. In fact, I keep coming up with new names that I've read over the years for the homogeneous solution, natural solution, right? Resonant, sometimes called the modes, the natural modes. So characteristics, solution, right? They're all kind of conveying the same idea. Now that was a series LC circuit. You might be wondering what a parallel LC circuit, well, forget this y for now. But we can analyze this circuit. And what we'll find is that the differential equation is exactly the same. So just for practice, let's do that. So now I have a current source and I have a voltage across this capacitor. I have a current through this resistor, which is simply V over R. And I have a current through this inductor. The current through the inductor. I can say, I can say that IS the current coming in. This current is equal to this current plus this current plus that current. Il plus, well, the current through the capacitor is CDVDT plus the current through the resistor is V over R. And we know that the voltage also is the same. The voltage across the cap is the same as the voltage across the inductor. For the inductor, the voltage depends on the rate of change of the current in the inductor. So I could integrate this expression and plug it into this first one. Or I could take a derivative of the first expression, prime, prime, prime, prime. In which case, I'll have the derivative of the source current is equal to I l prime. Well, I l prime is V over L, right? From this equation. Plus now I have c d squared v d t squared plus one over r d v d t. So again, I get a second-order differential equation. And if I want to put it into the same form as before, I can manipulate this and make it look exactly the same as before. And what you're going to find is the quality factor omega naught is still the same. The rate at which basically DKs or energy sloshes back and forth between the inductor and capacitor, that's omega naught. But what you'll find is that zeta is different. Or equivalently Q. Is not the same. So why is that? Why isn't the Q expression the same? Well, if you reason this through energy conservation, right? You realize that when you have a parallel resistor to have no loss, What should the resistor be? Should it be zero? Should be small, or should it be large? Larger is better, right? Because of the resistor is larger. Eventually it's an open circuit. If it's large enough, it's not there anymore in parallel. Whereas if it's small, it's going to dominate and take up a lot of current away from your tank, right? So the energy stored in the tank is now proportional to V, right? The larger the r is, the less current that goes into the resistor, and the less loss we have. In fact, we know that the ohmic losses are one-half RI squared, or equivalently one-half v squared over r. Right? Now, because we want it for a parallel circuit, we want to think in terms of voltage. Then V squared over R. To minimize that term, we need r to be big. So zeta is not gonna be the same, but you can find the equivalent form of zeta. And for this particular circuit, Q works out to be now are over omega naught L, or equivalently omega naught RC. So this is the approach that we took for a second-order circuit. You might be wondering what happens if we now, let's just add another element to this circuit. I think there's a question, Yeah. Good question. So what happens in steady-state? Yeah. So let's say that what should ISP should be a step function, should it be a sinusoid? You name it. Yeah, so let's say it's a step, right? So it's zero current. And then at time t is equal to zero, pops up to one amp. What happens in steady-state? Well, remember in steady-state inductors or shorts, capacitors are open. So in steady-state, all the current will flow through the inductor and the output voltage will be zero. Yes. Zero voltage, yeah. So how does the current source work? Yeah, remember a current source has the following I-V curve, right? It doesn't care what voltage it has, right? Have 0 v. Actually at 0 v, It's really happy because it's not doing any work. Actually. It's happier with negative voltages because then it's doing, someone else's doing the work, right? Alright, so we could go on and analyze these circuits in the same way. So let's, let's make the circuit a little more complicated. And just see what happens. Let's say we add a second capacitor here. I'll call this C2, C1. This is again V, S, L, and R. Okay? Let's write that. Let's try to write the differential equations for this. We certainly can. Let's say that the current here splits into, right. We could do a KVL and KCL, for instance, to get two equations. So we could say VS is equal to VC1. There's vc1 plus the voltage drop across the inductor is L DIDT. Let's call this current i plus Vc2. We need another equation. Basically, if we look here, we have three unknowns. The voltage on the capacitor, the current through the inductor, and the voltage on the second capacitor. So let's try to write a second equation. Let's say that the eye of the circuit, this is just called I. Again, this is the same I over here. It splits into two. It splits into the capacitor plus the resistor. So it gives me a second equation, okay? And I still need another equation. I could say. Okay. So basically we went around this loop. We can also go around this loop and say that the voltage drop across the capacitor is. Equal to the current through the resistor, which we're going to write as i minus c to d V, c to d t. Okay? So we're saying that going around this loop, this voltage here, let me draw it in another color, is equal to this voltage. And this current is actually I minus the current through the second capacitor. So we can see here that we have three equations and three unknowns. Usually when we have three equations, three unknowns we say, okay, we can solve this right? If they're linear system. But the problem is there's derivatives here, right? The question, someone had their hand up. Did I forget an art term? Yeah. Thank you. So the question is, how do we solve this? Now, it turns out that I can spend a lot of time here and play with these equations and convert them into a single differential equation. I can also tell you that equation is going to be cubic. I know that because there's three energy storage elements in here. Then we can use the exact same procedure that we did again before. We could say, let's do a trial exponential, we're going to end up with a cubic equation. There's three roots. Very similar procedure. But I don't really know how to do tangle these three equations yet, right? As I've written them, they're all tangled together. It's a question in the back. Did I mess up? Yeah, this is basically the same equation. Thank you. So yeah, for third equation, we could also do a KCL over here and let me see if this gives us another equation. So yeah, we could say that I of the inductor is also equal to c one DVC Juan de ti. Thank you. Now I indeed have three equations, three unknowns. But if you look at this equation, for instance, if I take a derivative of this term over here, then this becomes a second derivative. Let me actually do this. Let me take a derivative of this. This becomes the second derivative. So I could substitute over here. And I have a VC1 term. Then over here I have a VC2 term. If I were to take the derivative of the second equation, right? If I make a substitution, if I take a derivative of the second equation, I could substitute this term into here. I could play around with this and eventually actually end up with just one equation for one of the variables, right? And it's a mess, right? I can't give you like a general procedure for doing actually, I'm going to give you a general procedure for doing it. But just looking at it, it's kinda difficult to see what's going on. So a different approach, instead of trying to solve this equation by trial and error and playing around with these equations. Let's see how you could do it systematically. So let me take these three equations. And notice that there's three really interesting variables here. I'm going to call the vector v. Actually, they may not call it V because that implies voltage. Let me call it x, VC1, vc2. And you might wonder, why did I pick these three variables? Well, I actually purposely defined the three variables to represent the voltages on the capacitors and the current through the inductors. We call this the state of the system. So I'm going to basically tell you something really interesting and then I'll kinda prove it very quickly. Which is that if you know these three variables, in other words, if you know the state of the system, you know everything about the circuit. So you only really need to keep track of what's happening to these three variables. So why can I make that statement? Well, without doing a mathematical proof, I can actually just give you guys an intuitive proof. Imagine that you have your circuit with an arbitrary numbers of inductors and capacitors, right? Take out all the inductors and capacitors. So let me draw a picture here. Let me draw the same circuit just to give you guys, this is another one. I'll call this L1, C1, C2 are. So imagine that you take out all the capacitors and inductors here. Just represent these as voltage sources and current sources. You can solve this problem, right? This is, once I know what all the sources are, I can find all the rest of the voltages and currents in the system. Why am I only keeping track of the voltages and the currents, the currents and inductors and vultures on capacitors because those have memory, those are things that are going to evolve dynamically. Everything else in the circuit is kinda deterministic like resistors. If you know the voltage across the resistor, the current, the current through a resistor, you know, it's voltage. You don't need to know the past history. So it's not part of the state. You can determine it from the state variables, which are things that have dynamics involved. So this is the motivation. And if we go back to our system of equations, we'll notice that we could actually write these three equations as follows. I'm going to write this as DID. Let me, let me start off with the first equation that involves the first state variable. Let me get rid of that. So let's start out with VC1. So here I have D VC1, d t is equal to one over C19. Next, I'm going to go to the second state variable, which is DVC d2, d t is equal to one over C2. I guess with a minus sign here. Minus one over C2 are vc2. And finally, the first equation is DIDT is equal to VS over L plus one over L minus signs here everywhere. Vs has a positive sign and Vc2 over L. Okay? So I've just put all the derivatives on one side and left everything else to the right-hand side. Which allows me to write this as d by d t x is equal to something times VC1, vc2. And I. Well, the first equation, it's 001 over C1, right? Everybody see that? The second equation, it's zero minus one over C2, r minus one over C2. There should be all its current. Yeah, that's fine. Third equation has something extra. It has these basically three terms, minus one over L, minus one over L zero. But then it has a source term, which is one over L times V S. And so to make this a vector equation, I'm going to just put zeros, zero VS into my source. Sorry, you got cut off here a little bit. So once I have it in this interesting form, I claim I can take any circuit and put it into this form. Write again. Why is that true? Because no matter how many inductors and capacitors you are, as long as you keep track of their state, you can figure out what's happening in the rest of the circuit. And how do I figure out what's happening to the state of the system? Well, if I do KVL, KCL, whatever technique you like to write your equations. If you end up with a number of independent equations that represent the dynamics of the state. Because the inductors and capacitors only have first derivatives involved with them. We're always going to end up with an equation in this form that the rate of change of the state is equal to some matrix times the state itself plus whatever you're adding to the circuit, the sources. Okay. I think I saw a hand go up. Yeah, in the back. Let's see. Second equation. There's no VC1 term, right? The second equation is this is our right. Which, which term is wrong? This term to be positive. Okay. I trust you, I maybe made an algebra mistake and yeah. It's it's actually not that, you know, of course it is important when you're solving a problem. But the point I'm trying to make now is not to solve a problem with you, but to actually motivate this form of the solution. This is really important because once I put the solution into this form. I can now think about attacking this way systematically, using all the tools that you guys have from linear algebra? Yes. Okay. I didn't hear Can you say that again? Sorry. Yeah. The projector isn't quite sure. Okay. You guys can go home and figure out all the mistakes I made. The point I want to get across is this, that we can put our system into this form. And in discussion section, you're going to actually do an example and start playing with this kind of representation. The cool thing is that not only can we put circuits into this form, but it turns out that you could put a lot of dynamic systems into this form. Like a good example is a robot. If you look at a robot, if you can identify the state variables of a robot, then you could describe the robot motion and dynamics of how it evolves based on an equation looks just like this. Okay, so what linear algebra tools do we need? Well, the linear algebra tools that we need are going to be related to a change of basis, which actually is usually covered in 16, but apparently wasn't covered last time. So we'll cover it in today's lecture. So today's lecture is just the rest of the lecture is this linear algebra, which is very important as we'll see in today's lecture. So what I want you to think about is when you write down a vector, what does it really mean? Of course, it's different in different scenarios, but we can use a really simple analogy, which is vectors represent our coordinates, right? If you're anywhere in this room, if I define an origin, I can define, let's say a vector going that way, in a vector going this way. And of course everybody knows Cartesian coordinates. I could tell you where you're sitting. And I can use these two vectors as my basis vectors, right? You need to know what my basis vectors are. If I don't tell you what my basis vectors are and I tell you you're sitting at 5 m and ten comma 10 m. What does that really mean? So basis vectors are very important and we're used to using the standard basis vectors, right? The standard basis vectors are orthogonal to each other, right? But they're not the only basis vectors. In fact, what we're going to show you today is in many situations, the standard basis vectors result in very complicated equations. If we can look at things a little bit differently, the problem becomes much simpler. I'll give you a very simple analogy. Again, in two-dimensions, let's say we have two kinds of basis vectors. One basis vector. I'll show you a picture here, is basically we're going to map locations in Berkeley, right? So we're going to use downtown Berkeley. I'll use Jupiter as Downtown Berkeley, right across from my lab. So it's a nice location. Great outdoor garden. If you're ever wondering where to go to have a beer and relax. Here it is. Jupiter. So I'm going to define just two orthogonal vectors. Notice that I could really orient these vectors anywhere, like write the choice of putting them one going up and one going to the right. Actually is just motivated by the fact that the Earth has a magnetic field, right? There's a north pole. And I can get, take a compass and that points in the north. And so now with a little bit, I don't, I have like a universal coordinate system that everybody understands. Assuming the Earth's magnetic field is relatively uniform. So if I want to tell you, for instance, how to get to campus with the standard basis vectors, right? Let's say somebody asked you directions and they say, Well, how do I get to, you know, Cory Hall, right? So you could basically tell them will walk from downtown Berkeley, walk so many steps East, right? And then walk so many steps north and you'll get there. Okay. I also like, how do you get the cream, right? You have an urge, you want to have something at cream. How do you get the cream? Right? Again, same procedure. That's the standard basis vectors. But let's say that you're talking to a friend. And your friend lives in Berkeley, understands Berkeley. And you want to tell them an address near Cory Hall. What's more convenient to tell them? Okay. Walk towards cream or excuse me, walk toward walk east and then walk north. Know you're just going to tell them, Oh, Soda Hall is just across the street from Cory Hall. Just walk the query across the street, that's Soda Hall, right? So that Cory Hall is maybe a better basis vector because it's a well-known location, right? Likewise, going east as maybe not, not everybody has a compass. Not everybody kind of carries a mental compass around. Some people do actually, it's pretty impressive. But if you're like most people at any given point, you don't really know where East is, right? On the other hand, you might know, oh yeah, if I go in that direction, I'll get to my favorite coffee shop, or in this case, I'll get to cream. So let's imagine now using the basis vectors. This location from the origin downtown to cream. That's my first basis vector. From the origin to Cory Hall as a second basis vector, right? So now I can specify any point in Berkeley using those basis vectors. Is that a better representation than north and south? It depends, right? On some applications. North and South has great stranger comes to town. They want to know location. Tell them north, north and east, right? On the other hand, if you know Berkeley, you're probably going to use some local basis vectors that you're familiar with all its across from the library, right? Why is that important? Well, up to now, we've been representing vectors in terms of the standard basis, right? We call those E1, E2, E3. Write. The standard basis vectors are exactly like this northeast vector. When we talk about a mapping or we represented as a matrix, the form of the matrix actually depends on the choice of the basis vector. We'll show that in a minute. So if we were to change the basis, we can actually make the, make, if we change our basis vectors, we can make the linear transformation looked different, perhaps simpler. Okay? So again, the motivation here is I have this kind of ugly system of differential equations that I need to solve. Because I define my basis vector. What is my basis vector here? In essence, my basis is the voltage on the capacitor, the voltage on the capacitor second capacitor, and the current through the inductor, right? That's my basis. Maybe there's a better way of looking at this circuit. In which case these equations simplify, right? That's the motivation here. Can we rethink about our equations? So let's see how to relate to different bases, these to each other. Okay? Let's say we have a basis set v1 and we have another basis set, E1 and E2. And we want to find a relationship between these two. Given one coordinates, can we translate to another coordinate, right, if I give you north and east, can you give me the equivalent coordinates towards Cory Hall, towards cream? Right? How do we do that? In other words, if we have some arbitrary location, I'll call it z. That's equal to, let's say X1, y1 plus x2 e2. That has to equal to, let's call it y, y1, v1 plus v2, V2. Notice that not only are v1 and v2 naught orthogonal, they're also not normalized. They don't need to have unit magnitude, right? Doesn't matter. I can still write any point on the plane with vectors V1 and V2 using this form. What are the conditions of V1 and V2? In order for this to work linearly independent, Exactly, They need to be linearly independent. If V1 is equal to some k, v2, then obviously you're just describing points on one line and you're not getting the whole plane. So this, this can't be true. We need v1 and v2 to be linearly independent. And of course the standard basis vectors are linearly independent. Okay? Okay, skipped ahead in my notes a little bit. So let's let me actually just jump over here and not follow my notes. So basically when we write these linear combinations, right, let's generalize to EN, right? So I have X1, y1 plus x2, y2 plus XN EN. Well. We have a shorthand notation for this, right? This is really the matrix E times the vector x. It's the matrix vector product. Remember, there's two ways of looking at the matrix vector product. You can look at it as rows times columns. Or probably a better way to think about it is a matrix vector product is a linear combination of the columns of a matrix. This is what you learn in 16. So EX is a linear combination of the columns of e. E of course, is just the standard basis. Of course we usually call this i. So i'll, I'll call this I instead of E to be consistent. So basically, any coordinate in an n-dimensional space is just I times x, right? You might say, Well, why I times x is x? Well, the reason I write this is I want to equate this to another linear combination. We're going to call this y1, y1 plus y2 v2, YN, Vn, which we can also write as a matrix vector product. Let's call this matrix V, and let's call this vector y. And we can equate these two terms together. Which tells me that my coordinates, if I want to know the coordinates y from x, all I need to do is multiply by the inverse matrix V. Why can I do this? Why can I take the inverse of v? Yeah, we basically said that for a basis vector set to work, they need to be linearly independent. Columns of the matrix are linearly independent. We know that it's invertible, so we can invert this matrix. So this is a matrix, this is a transformation matrix. It takes us from North East coordinates, right in the two-by-two case, two coordinates of torts query towards cream, starting from unknown origin of downtown Berkeley, Jupiter cafe, Jupiter. So this is actually a transformation matrix. Anytime you want to change basis from one basis to another. In fact, we can generalize this and say if you have two different bases, like if you have basis a, call this XA, because they're both equivalent, there's nothing better about one basis than the other. They both describe the same locations. Any location z has to be described by either a times x a or b times x b. So a is the linear combinations of the vectors which are the columns of matrix a. Xb is a linear combinations of the columns of the vector b. So here we have basis vectors A1, A2, AN. And these are basis vectors b1, b2, bn. So if I want to go to, from coordinate system B to a, for instance, I could say that x B is B inverse a X. Of course I can go the other way around as well. And I might call this matrix, this transformation matrix, BA, because it takes coordinates from a and pushes them into b, right? So this is a change of basis. Okay. Any questions? The case that we just did a happened to be I. So we just got B inverse, right? Okay, let's actually now can look at a linear transformation. So what is a linear transformation? We know that a linear transformation takes vectors the x and maps them to some vectors z, right? And it's basically a mapping, right? It tells you that for every vector in one, you can give me any vector. I'll give you another vector. Let's say that's also in the same space, e.g. if you give me a vector anywhere in Berkeley, I'll give you another vector. Also in Berkeley, It's a mapping. Now what does that mapping mean? We can, of course, there's many. You can define an infinite number of mappings, right? One mapping might be just, Oh, it's the same location displaced or the same location rotated, or some weird linear combinations of distant locations. So how do I actually figure out what this mapping is, right? What's the procedure? How do I represent this mapping as a matrix? Yeah, exactly. So to figure out what the mapping is, let's just write v in terms of the basis vectors. So let's call this x V1 plus X1, X1, X2, V2, X3, V3, and so on. Now let's apply the mapping to v. Of course this is a linear mapping. So we can use linearity to say that, okay? What happens to v1, x2? What happens to V2? In other words, we're going to concern ourselves with how does the mapping effect the basis vectors. If we know what the mapping does to the basis vectors, then we know what the mapping does to any arbitrary vector because any arbitrary vectors and linear combination of the basis vectors. In fact, if you look at this equation, alright, this, let's call this A1. This is a vector A1, right? It's a mapping of V1 to another point. Call that A1, A2 and so on. And then this is a linear combination of these vectors, A1, A2, A3. Of course, we can also write this as a matrix product. In fact, that's how we define a matrix product. So what is the matrix a? The matrix a is what happens to the call to the basis vectors. We basically plug in every column of a. The first column of a is the mapping of the first basis vector, right? The second column of a is, how does the linear system map the second basis vector? The question is, how do we now change? How do we write a is in terms of a particular basis. How do we write a in terms of a new basis? So that's the question we want to tackle next. Questions so far, does this make sense? So let's say we have a mapping and it's in terms of the basis vectors V and the corresponding matrix we'll call a. Now we have another mapping. And let's say it's in terms of a. Actually, I guess I shouldn't say a because then it would call it something else. So let's call this one V. Let's call this one Y. So this is the same mapping. We're basically taking points and mapping them to other points. In the same basically vector space. We know that we can write the mapping either in terms of v, y, v or Y, and they should be the same, right? The points that they map should be the same. So if I were to take, let's say y, z is equal to V times little v. That should be the same. I want to now write this in terms of a different coordinate system, right? I want to write it in terms of coordinate systems y. So here the vector v, remember v is 10 all the way down here. It's just has a one that's not representing y1, right? What is it? You're right. So it's simply, simply stated, I'll get someone else to say what is this vector? I'll call this V one. Actually, I just call it what it is, right? This is what you want, right? If I put a one in the first location here in the first row and set the rest of the rows to zero. You have to get it into your mind. This is not, we're not talking about E1. We're talking about one times v1, the first basis vector. Likewise, if I put zero, let's say Alpha. What does this represent? It's not alpha times e2, right? It's alpha times V2. So it takes a little getting used to because we're so used to the standard basis. Alright, so I've got my mapping here. And I guess I call this little V. And I want to write this mapping. I want to change my coordinates to a different coordinate system, right? I want to maybe change to y. So the matrix, why? How is that related to VI? Well, I can always define a transformation matrix, right? I know that for any arbitrary vector v, x coordinate system V, it has to equal to y times the coordinates of a vector in coordinate system y. So I can rewrite v as v inverse y times y. Okay? And this is the transformation matrix T that takes me from y to z. So my goal is to eventually write this in terms of y. This is a definition for v, the definition, but this is also z is also equal to y times y, right? They have to be the same because they're the same point just described by the same transformation, right? If I plug in two points which are the same, just represented in different bases, and I'm Matt, both of them, they have to map to the same point because it's the same transformation. So v and y are the same transformation. You write that over here. So let me plug in here V, V inverse Y. And this gives me y is equal to, actually know that it's not what I want. Let me plug in v. V is equal to y. And then for y, I'm going to multiply it by T V inverse V, which lets me write V as V inverse Y TV y inverse. So let me call this instead of t VY. Be a little bit careful with notation T, Y v. So this is a transformation matrix that takes the vector v from v coordinates to y coordinates, right? So then I can write y is equal to that. And if I do that, then I have again pre multiplying everything by the inverse. I have V inverse T Y v, v. But this, this is a vector v. I want to take this into the coordinate system of v. So let me also multiply this by t y v. Let me just see, I think my notation is too confusing. I apologize. I have started start over again. Okay. Oh, I see what I'm doing wrong here. So now let's start out with this equation. And let's plug in the transformation matrix that takes us to v coordinates. Right? So now we have a coordinate system in z. So this Is a coordinate system in the Y system. In other words, this is equal to y times y. This is not right. Screwed this up. Okay, Let me follow my notes so I don't screw things up. So we have our, basically our mapping is defined. You have two mappings here. Wants to find in terms of v. One is defined in terms of why I'm calling this vector v, I'm calling this vector y. And I have, let's say z is equal to v times v. I also have z is y times y. Now, in order to transform things into here, let me multiply everything by the vector y v, z, TY V, VI, VII. And let me also change this from v to z. Let me call this new vector y. And let me now say that z is t y V inverse. I'm still doing something screwy here. We can figure this out. It's not complicated. This is in terms of v space. So let's write this as t, The y, z. I think what I'm doing wrong as equating these things. Yeah. They should not be equated because they're in different space representations. Okay, that's why I'm getting the wrong answer because they're not you don't equate them even though they represent the same point. They have different representations so the vectors will not be the same. So I really want to do is consult my notes. So let me just consult my notes here. Of course I use different notation. So here I'm going to have a transformation times some input x. And here I'm going to have another transformation, z times some vector y. Okay, so now let's say I want to write z in terms of v. I will multiply this by z is in terms of y. So I wanna go from V to Y, Z. That's now equal to V, which is V x, which is equal to t VY. Why? Why? Right? Now I can say that. What I'm trying to do is represent this in terms of V. So now I have this in terms of x. So let me multiply by the inverse t VY y, y. And if we know, okay, I made a bad mistake of picking very, very bad notation, which is confusing me because I don't want to waste your time. Let me just use the following notation. Oh, yeah. Okay. So let's say we have a vector x in standard basis. And then we have a vector y, which we have some linear transform a times x. Okay? Now, let's say that we have another basis, z, which we can get from X by transformation T x, x. Is that it? Yeah, I think I'll have to fix this next time since we're running out of time. But if this is so simple, what we've done is we've changed our transformation vector a into a new transformation vector that now lives in the z basis. And next lecture we'll, we'll do this a lot better. I apologize for screwing up. Alright. Thank you. Is class.
