Testing? Testing. Testing. Yeah. I think it's a little too. I'll bundle. So what's the capacity? Do you know? All right. Everybody. You guys hear me, okay. Alright, so find a comfortable place to sit. The first thing we're going to do as a roll-call, we're going to write down your name. You will get extra points for participation for coming today. Actually, I'm going to just take a picture of you guys and then we'll just figure out your faces later. Just kidding. Hi, I'm now they make their job. I'm gonna be your co-instructor. Let's cut on. The other co-instructor. I'm one of the head TAs this semester. I'm another head TA this semester. So before we actually get into the course content, we need to, it's a big course as you guys all know, you guys all are coming from 16, a lot of logistics to take care of. So NEMA and Bridget are going to run us through that. Can you can you guys hear me with this? That's working. Okay, great. Alright, thanks for coming today. Thanks for being here for the first lecture. Nice to see you all. Alright, so our website isn't fully complete yet, so we only have a partial picture of our staff. These are some of the head TAs Stella and then each couldn't make it. Stella is another admin, TA and a niche is the content TA this semester. Alright, so let's talk about course format a little bit. We'll have lectures Tuesday, Thursday, 930-11 am in this room. Payments L1. Discussions are Monday and Wednesday. So just note that Monday's discussion is different from Wednesday's discussion. And we're going to ask you to attend both. And make sure you get checked off. At the end of each discussion. Your TA is going to give you a link to a Google form and you'll punch in some information and a password and then that's how we're going to check you off. You can choose any time that works for you. Monday, Wednesday. You can go maybe 10:00 A.M. Monday and 12:00 P.M. Wednesday, if that works for your schedule, will have one homework every week and it'll be posted on the course website. There is also going to be one pre-lab assignment and one lab every week, also posted on the course website. And this class will have two exams, one midterm, one final. The midterm date has not been decided yet. We'll hopefully announced that soon. And the final is May 10, 11 30 to 02:30 P.M. if you have a conflict for the final, please let us know sooner than later so we can accommodate you hopefully. And here's some important websites look out for. First off, we have the course website. And this is where we announced our policies, where we released discussion worksheets, homeworks, labs, our course notes, and also the calendar. This is where you can find the schedule for discussions, lecture and labs, and also office hours. You'll find the lecture recordings on B courses. You can ask questions and also answer questions on our course ed. And you'll submit your assignments largely on grade scope, your homeworks, pre-labs and labs. And to go over some of the course items that are available to you right now. We have homework zero, which is due next Tuesday. It has a few administrative questions and the rest of it is basically redoing the final. We have two lectures this week on Tuesday today and one on Thursday. And then our first discussion section starts tomorrow. So please make sure that you attend and get checked off for it. And asked for some resources. We have we have office hours starting this week. They are in-person and you can find the schedule on the 16-bit calendar. And we also have students support office hours in case you want to talk about maybe how to get caught up in this class, how to succeed, or if you want to let us know any extenuating circumstances you're facing. And we also have some assignment extensions which you can find the form in our syllabus later this week. And if you have any privacy concerns, please e-mail us as well. We have many more resources on our website, so please make sure you read that thoroughly and read our syllabus thoroughly. And if you have any questions please ask on Ed or you can come to us in office hours. And yeah, that's about it for the logistics, I'll pass it back to the professor's. Alright, thank you very much. So before class I put up some review material on the board. This is, I'm assuming you guys all know this stuff. So we'll just jump into the new material. Okay. So for those of you who came in late, My name is Arlene IC Dijon. I'm co-teaching this with my partner in crime, Professor Ramachandran here as well. And we're gonna do kind of a review lecture today on capacitors. Not all the material will be reviewed. So if there's new stuff here, that's a good thing. I'm gonna kinda give you my perspective on what capacitors are and how we use capacitors in engineering. Also, this is a big class, so it may be awkward, but if you do have a question, I'm burning question. It's very likely that many other people do and it's holding you back from actually understanding the material. I want your time in lecture to be useful. I don't want you to just come here and listen to me and then go home and try to figure out what I said. So if there's something holding you back from understanding the material, definitely raise your hand. Don't be shy. I tell all my students. The most important reason that you want to ask questions is what? Anybody know why you want? What's the most important reason to have questions at your disposal? Even dumb questions, quote unquote dumb questions. It's just slow down the lecture, right? If somebody's going too fast, you can't like say Professor slowed down, but you can ask a question, right? And that will automatically slow them down. Okay? So reading materials, so this class, we don't have a textbook. Last semester. They followed handling or two semesters ago. I won't be following Hamlet. Although if you'd like to have a textbook to look at, this is a good book. Some of the material will overlap, a lot of it will not, but we will have excellent course notes that the staff has put together over the years and there'll be new material generated this time around. So go to the course website and you'll see links to everything. I will also put up a link to this textbook as well. Again, this is optional and this is only for the first ten or so weeks of the class. Are ten weeks. Ten classes are about five to six weeks. There are a couple of books out there that I put together, one of the 16 a reader, some of you may have seen it already. And another one is a 105 reader. So for those of you who are going to go on to, let's say the, what we call the phi ink side of electrical engineering, physical electronics, integrated circuits. You might want to take a look at the 105 book, maybe at the end of this class because there's introductory material in that book that reviews what you should have learned in 16 B. It's also good material to look at. So look at it maybe as we go along or at the end, it's the first couple of chapters of that book. Both of them are online. And if you have any feedback or corrections, please. Reach out, I appreciate it. Alright. So I just wrote down some of the things that I remember that we taught the first time we offered a that was a while back. So everything on this looks, Let's look. Okay. You guys should know what voltage, current and charge. Our guys should know what energy is power is, and electrical circuits should be familiar with resistor's voltage, current sources, dependent sources. I know sometimes they get a poor treatment in introductory courses where they're kinda just glossed over. But they turn out to be really important because every transistor amplifier is, we model it as a dependent source. So it's very important to understand dependent sources. Capacitors, which we'll review today, should be comfortable solving circuit equations with KVL, KCL, node analysis. Some of you may know loop analysis or mesh analysis. You should also be able to analyze circuits more just by inspection, write using things like voltage dividers, current dividers be able to use linearity and superposition to figure out a more difficult problem. And most importantly, you also should be comfortable with Norton and Thevenin equivalent. In other words, you shouldn't be able to take a complicated circuit and simplify it using source transformations. Should also be familiar with the concept of what a load is and what a source is like. If you have a voltage source, it's not ideal. It has source resistance, right? A battery has some resistance which limits how much current it can deliver, which limits what kinds of loads you can drive, right? So these concepts are all very simple, but definitely take some time to learn. Anything on this list, pop out that you guys think he didn't really cover that? Well, yeah. Yeah. Dependent sources look like this. This is a dependent source. It's basically the difference between an independent and dependent sources, the following. So here's an IV curve. So this is current, this is voltage. And if I tell you, okay, this is my source, right? What kind of sources? This it's an independent, in this case, current source, right? Because the current is always constant, it doesn't matter what voltage you put across it. Likewise, a vertical line is a voltage source. It's an independent voltage source. There's no dependencies, right? That's why we say it's independent. On the other hand, if we look at something like a, we draw something else. Don't notice I'm drawing a family of curves. I'm saying that the current depends on some parameter, alpha v x one, alpha v x2 and so on. So here I am telling you that look, the current through this device has a parameter Alpha, and it depends on some voltage. We'll call it V x, right? This is a dependent source. Makes sense. You guys covered that, right? In 168? Yes, no. A little bit. Okay. Anything else from this list that pops out? This is the time to bring it up. Because if there is, we can definitely review material. We have discussion sections. Yeah. Yes. A good question. That is the I-V curve of a dependent source different than a resistor? It is because for a resistor There's just one curve, right? So if I were to draw the I-V curve for a resistor, it's just this with a slope one over r. That's why I had to draw a family of curves because the current depends, it depends on what this other voltage V exits, right? That's the difference. Okay. Anything else? Yes. You elaborate on loads? Loads. Okay. We'll come back to this. So I'm going to put a little asterisk next to questions that you guys have. Yeah, so the idea behind a load is actually quite straightforward. Let me say I have a battery. Okay? This is a battery. And I hook it up to, let's say some kind of light bulb or something. Question is, how much light am I going to be emitting? Right? So in this picture, this is our load, the light bulb, and this is our source. So maybe when you were in high school, you would draw a circuit like this. But of course. Now you just draw a circuit that looks like this. You say, okay, my battery is some voltage source V, and it has some source impedance R s. My load can be represented as RL. In this case, it's a light bulb. It has, if you put a certain voltage across it, it emits a certain amount of light. We're converting electrical energy into light. Well, we'll just model it with a resistor. And we'll just basically this is our circuit now. So this is the load and this is the source. Okay? Yes. You have the source resistance to determine this thick. If you're in the lab, how would you figure out what the source resistance is? Maybe a little dangerous, but you could do it the easiest way. Okay. Short the battery. That's the dangerous part, right? If you short a battery, you could start a fire, right? Because batteries have very small internal resistance, has got a huge current. It'll heat up, it'll melt. What's a safer way of doing it? If I didn't quite get what you said, I think it was probably right, but if it took so many words, it's more complicated than what I was thinking. Yeah. Just build this circuit in the lab, right? If you build this circuit in the lab, if an open-circuit voltage is 10 v, and when you hook up this load, you, you measure 9 v. And this load, let's say is one kiloohm. You can figure out what our S is, right? Okay. Let me just remind you of Thevenin and Norton. Did you guys spend a good amount of time doing thevenin? Norton's? Good. Okay, we'll skip it. Alright, what is the concept of Thevenin Norton. Let me explain Thevenin and Norton in terms that are a little bit different. Let's say I go into your house or your apartment, and I'm looking at the wires. Let's say there's two wires coming into your house, right? This is coming from the from the generator for the power lines, right? So from the power lines we're going to disconnect the power lines. And I'm going to say, what's inside your house? Electrically, like what's hooked up to these wires, right? Obviously you have a bunch of switches. You have a fuse, right? You have forget all that stuff. At the end of the day, there's a microwave, there's a TV, There's a Internet, There's a router, and so on, right? There's a bunch of electrical devices hooked up. Now from the perspective of someone just looking in, I can model all of that with what what does your house look like from the perspective of two wires going into your house? Just a resistor, right? Unless you're running a power station in your house, right? Or if you have a battery hooked up. Right. But let's say you don't have a power station in your house. You know, technically we should say your house isn't impedance, but we haven't talked about impedances yet. From our perspective today, we'll just call it a resistance. And it's basically like let's say you have your left your hairdryer plugged into the wall. Right. And it's off. So coming and that's the only thing hooked up. Let's say there's an empty house and there's just a hairdryer there and it's off. So if I come in and I look at the equivalent resistance of your house, what am I going to see? Infinite? Yeah, because the hairdryers off or I'll see some very high resistance because eventually you can get current to flow. But for all practical purposes it's infinite. Let's say you left your hairdryer on and it took kilowatt hairdryer, right? I am too it's too early for me to do math, but, you know, 120 v RMS. We haven't talked about AC power yet, but you could figure out what 1 kw, what the equivalent resistance is, right? Of that dryer. So that's what I see. I just see a dryer That's some resistance that generates 1 kw of power when I apply 120 v RMS on it. Can we haven't talked about RMS, don't worry, I'll just say it for correctness. Now let's say we hook up a toaster. A toaster looks a lot like a hairdryer. The hairdryer has a motor and a heating element at toaster just has a heating element. It also has another resistors. There's two resistors in parallel. Well, I know how to simplify two resistors in parallel. And you see where this is going at the end of the day. You have a bunch of devices connected in parallel and series, mostly in parallel, right? And that is the equivalent resistance looking into your house, right? That's what Thevenin theorem says, is that you can take all the junk in your house and represent it with one resistor. Now, let's say. You happen to have a battery in your house hooked up to the house. Not a usual arrangement, but some people, power goes out. You might have a battery backup generator. In that case, you not only see the resistance is hooked up, but you also see that battery. So you see this Thevenin equivalent voltage source. I would figure out what the Thevenin equivalent voltage sources by measuring the open circuit voltage of your house. If I come into your house, I disconnect you from the power line. If I measure the voltage, I should see zero. But if I see a voltage, if I see 10 v, that means somewhere in your house, you've got a battery and that voltage divided and looking into it from the outside, it looks like 10 v, right? That's why there's a V Thevenin there. Alright. Any questions? Now? What about Norton's theorem, right? Well, as far as I'm concerned, if you think about it, I can't really tell. Like this model here is no more valid than this model. They both say the same thing. If I measure the open-circuit voltage, right? Your, your house is a linear, I'm assuming your house is linear, right? That's a big assumption. Somebody should have raised their hand, said, actually you're wrong. That toaster is non-linear. The resistance changes depending on the temperature. Yes, you're right. This is an approximation. We're assuming your house is linear. And if your house is linear, then basically looking into your house, there's just two variables, right? There is a voltage and a current. There's the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current. Or if you want to be safe, don't short-circuited hookup some resistor. Once I know the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current of your house. I know everything. I can model your house with either of these circuits because they're both saying the same thing. They both will have the same open-circuit voltage that they need to have. And they both will have the short-circuit current that they need to have, right? So over here, if I short-circuit your house, a current IN, flows into this external wire that I'm hooking up to your house, right? That tells me what? That there's a battery in your house because current is flowing. Same thing here. Over here, the short-circuit current would be V7 and over R Thevenin. So now you know how to convert a Norton into V7 it, okay? Now this is extremely powerful because it lets us abstract away all the details. We use this every day in my field because it lets us take something very complicated and represented with something very simple. And we'll see examples of that in class. Um, you know, a lot of engineering is about abstracting away details. Building a simple model, then using that simple model to solve your problems. And this is a powerful tool for doing that. Okay, So let's return capac capacity. Let's now return to kind of other material which is kind of today's lecture is all about capacitance. And of course, you guys have all seen capacitance before it was in 16. Many of you saw in your high school physics courses or college physics courses. The one thing I want to bring up here is a little bit of a different perspective, which is, what are the units of capacitance, right? If you think about it, I tell you the units of capacitance, everyone will say, Oh, it's a faraday, right? If you remember 0 in honor of Michael Faraday, the units of capacitance are Faraday's. But what does that mean? Right, if I go to, to somebody who's in elementary school and say, Hey, a capacitor has units of Faraday, has no meaning, right? Associated with that. Maybe there's some historical association going Wiki, Wikipedia lookup, Faraday, Oh yeah, he's a cool guy. He did some really nice stuff. But physically, what is capacitance? What are the units of capacitance that gives you physical intuition on what capacitances. Well, I'm gonna tell you the answer. It's just units of dimension. Capacitance is telling you how big something is, right? It comes from the word capacity. So it turns out in natural units, if we forget about epsilon, the permittivity of the material that you use to build the capacitors with than the units of capacitance just come out to dimension. The bigger something is, the more capacity it has to store charge. So think of capacitance as the capacity to store charge. If that doesn't make sense yet, hopefully, by the end of today's lecture it will. Of course, you guys have seen capacitors all over the place, right? There's capacitors on PCBs. They look like the ones up there, right? There's different kinds. There's an electrolytic capacitors, they're ceramic capacitors. Then there's those big capacitors, right? Maybe you didn't even realize you're looking at capacitors. But if you look at like power lines and power stations, you've got these big cylinders, you see them also on transformers. Sometimes. Those are big capacitors, very big capacitors. Then you've got banks of capacitors that you might have for an EV charging station or something that we'll talk about that in a minute as well. Capacitors come in many different forms and sizes. These are, there's two things I really want to emphasize today is capacitors as things that we built. And capacitance as just a natural property of basically of electromagnetic something that we just get like it or not. So let's look at the relationship between capacity, voltage, and energy. My daughter is doing freshman physics in high school and she's learned about voltage. And so I asked her, I said what is voltage, right? Just kinda like the Faraday question. To her. It didn't mean anything. Voltage, voltage, right? It's somebody's name. But at the end of the day, voltage is really just energy normalized to charge, right? Voltage is how much energy does it take to take charge and bring it up to a certain point in space, right? So if I, if I take a charge over here, delta q, delta q means it should be a small charge so it doesn't disturb my system. And I'm going to move it to this point. Xyz. How much energy was involved in that transaction, right? How much work did I have to do? Well, if this is vacuum and there's nothing else around, more or less, how much energy does it take? If there's nothing else around? And if we don't talk about self energy of electrons and stuff, then you could say, yeah, zero. Let's just say you move it around slowly so we get rid of the self energy problems. So there's no relativistic effects, but we move it around slowly. We bring it over here. Didn't take any energy because there's nothing to repel it, right? Charges attract or repel each other. Now I'm going to put a big charge q over here. It took zero, Let's say it took zero energy too big this bring this lump of charge to that point. And now it's settled there and it can't move. I glued it down onto the ground with some superglue. And now I take delta Q and I bring it to the same position. Well now it takes work, right? Because if both of these charges are positive, then these charges repel each other, right? And so it takes energy to bring delta Q to the same position, XYZ. Let's call that energy ie. Alright? Let's define the voltage as E divided by delta Q. Okay? So that's what really a voltage is. It explained to my daughter. I don't think she got it. I said, You know, voltages, energy normalized to charge. So now, if another delta q, twice as big comes in, I know how much energy it's going to take to go to that same position in space can take twice as much energy because it's twice as much charge, but the voltage is the same. So if I say that this, this point is at one volts, then I'm saying that it takes 1 v per coulomb to come to this point. But I left something out. What did I leave out? Yeah, exactly. Whenever someone says voltage, in your mind, think what is the reference point, right? It's a lot like talking about the height of a building, right? Someone tells you that this building is such and such height, right? Implicitly they're talking about relative to sea level. But if that building happens to be on a hill, right, you have to add the height of the hill plus the height of the building relative to sea level. So of course, when people talk about the height of a building, they don't mean sea level, they usually mean by the ground floor, right? It's a relative thing. So here are my references, infinity, really far away. I could have made the reference point here. I could have said this point as another point. I'll call it x1, y naught, z naught. That's my reference point. It's not infinity. It's basically how much energy does it take to go from this reference point, not to this arbitrary point x, y, z. That means the potential at that point is 1 v relative to that point. It takes 1 v of energy to go from there to there. Let's say 1 ev of energy if you're moving electrons around. Well, what if you take another path, right? Let's say I take this path. How much energy does it take? 1 v 1 ev, right, again, the same amount of energy. It's path independent. It's a property of electrostatics. It doesn't depend on path, It's basically just depends on the position. So this is path independent. So if we say that this is 1 ev, it doesn't depend on how you get there. You can even do crazy things like this and end up here. It's the same amount of work. And of course that's a lot like. Taking the stairs on a building, if you happen to have no friction in your body, right? Okay, let's define it this way. What's your potential energy and the building, right, relative to gravitational potential. It doesn't depend on how you got up to the fifth floor. If you jump off the fifth floor, your leg is going to break and hurt just the same amount. If you walk up there right to the 10th floor and then come back to the fifth floor and then jump or just go to the fifth floor and jump. Right. It doesn't matter how you get to the fifth floor, the amount of pain you're going to feel, it's more or less the same unless you happen to break your foot going up the hill. But that's a summing things complicated. Okay, So now what is capacitance in terms of energy? So the definition of capacitance is this, which we all know and love that we learned in 16 a. How should I think about this in terms of dimensions? As I said earlier. What this equation is telling you is that first of all, capacitors hold energy. Why do they hold energy? Well, if you charge a capacitor up to certain voltage, you can then discharge the capacitor and get the energy back. So therefore, it must take energy to put charge into the capacitor because you can always get that energy back. So capacitors store energy. They don't destroy energy. They're not like resistors are light bulbs that take the energy away. Resistors take the energy way into heat. Light bulbs take the energy away and produce light and heat, right? Hopefully mostly light. But a capacitor takes the energy and just stores it, stores it inside. And this equation, what it's telling you is if you charge up a capacitor, let's say to 1 v, how much charge is it holding for 1 v, right? How much capacity does it have? How much charge fits into the capacitor for a given voltage? Okay. It's a lot like saying how many people fit into a bus, right? Well, it depends on the conditions. Right? Let's say the conditions are that we're in peak COVID times and we need to have a separation of 1 m between everybody, right? Maybe only ten people fit in the bus. Okay. Now, let's say there's a World Cup event. We're trying to get people to the stadium as much as possible. We can tolerate putting people physically next to each other, right? Maybe you can put 100 people on the bus. That's the sum of the capacity that bus depends on some quantity. In this case is how willing are we to put people close together? And of course, the closer the people have to be, the more angry they're going to be, right? They don't want to be close together, right? So by analogy, when you put electrons into a capacitor and you put charge into the capacitor. You have to do work because the charges don't like being near each other, like charges repel each other. So if I'm putting, if I have a plate and I'm putting electrons onto that plate, I'm asking how many electrons fit onto this plate? It's just like the bus. You have to say, well, it depends. How much work are you willing to do? Because trust me to push people onto that smelly bus takes work, right? Pushing electrons onto this plate is going to take work because they don't want to be there. They repelled by other electrons. And so if you're willing to do 1 v of work, 1 ev of work, let's say. Then so many electrons will fit, right? It's this equation. So the capacity tells you how many people fit per unit voltage of work that you're willing to do. So this is the number of electrons. Of course, like let me just say coulombs Slayton because we're talking about in general. So coulombs of charge that fit into capacitor if you're willing to do. Okay. So of course, 1 v of work is really not a unit of energy, right? So this is a little bit loose here. It's normalized energy, It's 1 v per unit charge of work. So we'll come in and refine this in a minute. What I'm trying to do here is give you some intuition for what capacitance is, why capacitance has units of physical dimension. So earlier, I haven't proven it to you yet. But you can kind of imagine that the bigger an object is just like a bus. If I have a bigger bus, I can fit more people inside. Have a bigger structure, you can probably fit more electrons. The reason is quite simple. Imagine putting your first electron into the plate, into the structure doesn't have to be a plate. It could be some metallic cage. It could be anything. How much work does it take to put the first electron into the structure? Let's call it a bus. How much work does it take to put that electron on the zero, right? Because there's no one else in the bus. Electrons quite happy to go in and we'll find a place to settle down. Electron number two arrives. Now it takes a little bit of work to convince the electron to go into the bus because there's another electron there, right? The bigger the bus though, the happier the second electron is gonna be. Because he can be really far away from the first electron, right? So the two electrons are going to go as far apart from each other, right? So I can to people on the bus, very awkward when, when someone sits right next to you and the bus is empty, right? Electrons don't do that. They will go and find the seat furthest possible. And so on. The more electrons you have, they're all going to spread out. And so the physical dimension determines the capacitance. How much energy are we talking about here? I just did a quick Google search last night and did a couple of calculations. You know, it's really interesting to know how much energy is involved in storing energy. And we have different ways of storing energy. We can store energy in a capacitor. We can store energy in a battery. We can also take solar energy that's been harvested for a whole year and store it inside of a cow, right? Yeah. Battery and a great question. We'll come back to that. Is there a difference between a battery and capacitor? There is, there's a big difference. And we're going to talk about that today. So running the numbers, I just looked up online. If you have about a kilogram of weight, What's the biggest capacitor you can buy? And if you guys can find a bigger capacitor, let me know. I found one that was 580 micro farads. It can tolerate 450 v. If you go more voltage than that, the capacitor breaks down. It doesn't work after that. And so there's an equation, well, let's derive that equation for how much energy you can store in a capacitor. Well, what we said is that we know that Q is equal to CV. And I know that the energy is q times v, right? So he might think, let me just substitute over here. And I'll get Cv squared. It turns out this is the wrong answer, right? Why is this the wrong answer? Because you're using delta v. Yeah, What's another way of saying that? What would this calculation is wrong? Because in this calculation I assume that your capacitor already was charged up to a voltage of V. And now I'm going to put all the charge in there, right? That would take an energy of QV squared. But remember the first electron that gets on the bus, you don't have to do any work. The second electron, very little work. It's only the nth electron where the bus is full when you've got a really shove them in, right? So we have to integrate. So if we integrate, we say that d is C dv dt and we integrate, then we can actually get one-half CV squared. So using this equation, I calculate for a capacitor that's 580 microfarads. If I, if I were to charge it up. So it gets to 450 v. There's an energy of one-half CV squared and that is a quantity of 59 joules. Okay, is that a lot of energy? Well, let's compare it. Let's compare it to a kilogram of steak. Now it's not quite a fair comparison. But if you go on nutrition websites and how much energy, how many calories are in steak? First of all, you have to remember that when you say 250 calories in 1 kg of steak, if I remember, it was about 250 calories. It's really kilocalories for some reason, people drop the K, So it's 250 kcal and if you convert them to joules, It's a whopping 10.5 megajoules. That's a lot of energy, right? That capacitor, almost 1 million times, one-sixth times 1 million less energy. So there's a lot of energy stored in meat, right? How about batteries? Tesla is probably a good example right there, leading the way, or they were before they bought Tesla. Twitter. Leading the way on producing the most energy-efficient EVs, their batteries. If I believe this tweet, I saw third-generation batteries or 333 watt hours per kilogram, translating that into joules, that's 1.1 megajoule. So still ten x less energy than beef, right? So but what's the difference here? The difference is. It takes energy to take beef and produces energy, right? It's not a trivial process. It requires digestion, it requires a lot of processing. The energy from the battery is pure raw electric energy. I can extract it instantaneously, right? And the battery is almost as good. But there is a difference between a battery and a capacitor, and we should talk about that. So let's talk about the difference between a battery and a capacitor. So a battery on an IV curve is what? We model it as an independent voltage source, right? So this is, this is a model, it's not really reality because if it were, we had solved all of the world's energy problems in one step, right? Just take one voltage source and just keep extracting energy from it. Doesn't work that way, right? So apparently this is a model that's only valid on a short timescale because a real battery, as you use it, what happens to the voltage? The voltage goes down, write it discharges that you have a question. I just want to let me come back to that. So the stay on this battery topic. So the battery can't really be modeled correctly because there's no concept of time here, right? How about a capacitor? The capacitor look like on an IV curve? Again, similar to a battery. There's no way to model it. Now with a battery, this model is actually not a terrible model because let's say over the scale of several hours, the voltage of the battery is going to be more or less constant. Let's look at the voltage another way. Let's say I'm going to look at the voltage versus time. And I'm going to just hook up a resistor R here. Here's my battery. And I'm going to just observe it over time and I might see it discharging like this. And then something bad happens and it does something like that, right? It depends on the chemistry of the battery. But a battery internally is like a generator. There's a chemical reaction that's generating the voltage. And as long as there's enough material to make this reaction go, it will continue to generate the voltage, but at some point it runs out, it discharges. What we're going to learn in this class is that a capacitor? There is no chemical reaction driving it. There's nothing stored in the capacitor except the energy that you put into it. So a capacitor, once you start drawing current from it, it just immediately starts to discharge. We're going to look at the details of this discharge characteristic in the next, today's lecture and also maybe a little bit next lecture. But this is the big difference between a capacitor and a battery. A battery is storing energy using chemicals and it's actively driving a reaction to generate more energy, a capacitor is just giving you the energy that you put in? Yes. Sure. For the instant that you turn it on, It's an energy source, right? And if it looks like a battery, but very quickly it starts to discharge. Okay, So there's a question about the energy. So let's go back to this energy. So this is q d v. Let's say q is c v, dq is C dv. So here, if I substitute, Let's see. So I want to say energy is q. So let me say here c d v, dv. And then let me integrate this. So I get one Cv squared divided by two times c. And this is the energy stored in a capacitor. So from this equation, it seems like you can store as much energy as you want and a capacitor, right? If you can make the voltage large enough. But in reality, there is a limit. Let's say we built a very simple capacitor out of two metal rods, right? Put it right next to each other. What's the maximum voltage I can put into this capacitor? Yeah, up until the air breaks down, right? Because there's gonna be a huge electric field between these two rods. And those electric fields actually will affect the air between them. Inside the air, there's atoms that have their own electric field. And this external electric field can be strong enough that it can start pulling electrons out of these atoms, which are initially more or less neutral. And then you can get a plasma, you have charge of a gas, you get electrical discharge through them. So there is a maximum voltage. And generally, the bigger you make your capacitor, right? You put those rods far enough from each other, the more voltage you can put on it, but there's more physical dimension involved. So personally, I like the analogy of a bathtub a lot for a capacitor, but we have to be careful because There's two kinds of charges. But if we just think about one kind of charge, a bath tub is a really good analogy for a capacitor. Because imagine a bathtub that has no limit. It's infinitely tall, right? So I pumping water into this bath tub, the water represents the charge and the height of the water represents the voltage. It's a good analogy because that's the potential energy. And I can extract, right? I can now extract energy back from the bathtub. I can pump water into a bathtub and then I can let the bathtub go down. As it goes down, it pushes water out. So there's energy being stored in a bathtub. The key point though, is, remember when I was a student, I saw textbooks where they showed the water faucet up here and water coming in to the bathtub. That's absolutely the wrong picture. The right picture as the water is being pumped from the bottom of the bathtub. I believe we should call this a water tank. The water is being pumped in from the bottom. Because that tells you, the more water in the bathtub, the more energy it takes to put more water in. It takes into account that integration that we did Cdb, right? If you're already have a volt of water in the bathtub, It's going to take more energy to push water in to get it to some v plus delta v, right? Whereas when it's empty, it takes no work to put a delta Q of water into their right to me to raise it the delta V. You can also see the difference between a big fat tank and a nice small narrow tank, right? For the same amount of water, the same amount of charge that's being stored. The big fat tank will have a very small voltage, very small height. The small tank, it will rise up really high, right? Because that's the way it works, right? So this is a good analogy. Let me skip this slide here. Let me just do a quick calculation of what we've been talking a lot about capacitance. Let's try to calculate what the capacitance if something is. And I'm going to calculate the capacitance or the sphere. So I'm going to say this is a conductive sphere. To calculate the capacitance. I need. You might be objecting here, right? Any objections to the calculation of the capacitance of a sphere? Everybody feel comfortable if I give you 10 min, you can all figure it out what the capacitances. Good question. Does there need to be another conductor, right? How do you store charge in a sphere, right? You just put charge on the sphere. Problem with that, right? I can put positive charge on the sphere. All I want. Specifying. It doesn't matter. It could be a solid sphere, could be a shell, it could be anything. Can I associate a capacitance as well? It goes back to the reference problem, right? Capacitance is Q is equal to CV. What's V? To figure out v in the reference point. So let me make my reference point infinity over here. So to charge up this capacitor, I'm going to move little bundles of delta Q charge onto this plate. Technically, they have to be infinitely small. But in practice, we know we can go smaller than the charge of an electron. But I'm going to just take electrons one-by-one and shuttle them in and bring him in. And we don't want it doesn't depend on the path from electrostatics. I just take whatever path I want and I just put them on the sphere. Okay? And I want to know if the sphere of charges up to 1 v. How much charge Q as that take the ratio. Boom, I've got the capacitance. Now, maybe this is a good point to actually stop and talk about what a conductor is. Of course, to really describe what a conductor is, we have to take this course here, right? It's really understand the chemistry and the physics of what's going on. But for this class, what we're going to say is a conductor is a material where charges can move about freely. So if I put a little electron here, this electron, there's nothing stopping it from moving it around. It's practically free to go wherever it wants to go. In fact, there's a sea of electrons. There's a bunch of electrons in this conductor that are free to move about. Well, we know something about chemistry. We know that usually the electrons are not free, right? Why not? Because they're bound, right? Two new nuclei right there actually orbiting the nuclei in so-called orbits. But they have to stay close to the nucleus, right? They can't just move around freely. They're forming bonds. Conductors are materials where the arrangement of the atoms works out so that a bunch of those electrons actually don't necessarily need to stay close to one particular host. Let's say Adam, they're pretty much free to move about. It's kind of like a community. Like you can imagine two kinds of communities. You have community. One where the kids basically stay in their houses. They're not allowed to leave. They have to stay close to home. The parents are constantly vigilant, watching them, not letting them go far away. And you have another community where the kids are free to roam. The kids belong to the community. They come home from school. They go to Joe's house and they go to Samantha's house and they play soccer, then they go play in the hills. That's a conductor where the electrons are free to move around. The other kind of material where the electrons have to stay home are insulators. The electrons can't participate in conduction. That's really what a conductor is at the end of the day. So a conductor means the electrons are free to move. So if I apply an external field, some external electric field, then all the electrons will respond. They will feel a force, right? They'll feel a Coulomb force that will push them to the boundary of this conductor, right? They'll keep moving until they hit the boundary. So all the free charges will end up on the boundary. So these are some positive charges have to be involved in generating this electric field. And so that means all the negative charges will actually end up on this side of the structure. Well, the chart, Let's say this material, It's just a chunk of a conductor is not new. It's not charged initially, it's charged neutral. Well, if all the electrons are ending up on one side, that means that they're leaving behind net positive charge inside, right? Every time these electrons move, if you, microscopically, if I just before I apply the electric field, if I look inside this conductor is charged neutral because there's free electrons moving around, but there's also positively charged ions which are part of the bond structure, the crystal structure or whatever the material happens to be. Those positive charges are still there. The electrons are just moving around on average at any given region is charged neutral. But now if I apply an electric field, those electrons, if they're truly free to move, they're going to move towards the positive charge right there, attract the positive charge. So they end up on the boundary over there where there's positive charge, which means they leave behind positive charge inside the material. And you can show it in electrostatics that the net charge in this structure all ends up on the boundary. Because if your electric, all the electrons keep moving until they end up on the boundary. And the end result is that you have charges on the boundary of the structure and no charges inside. Now an insulator is very different. And an insulator, if I were to just take the last electron, Let's say we're talking about orbitals. These electrons, they are actually forced to stay, put. Their participating in bonds. They're holding the structure together. They're not free to move around. And so if I apply an electric field. This material, let's say it's charged neutral. Again, I apply an electric field here. What are these electrons? Do? They have to stay in the bonds. There's not enough energy to pull them out. They're stuck, right? So the only thing they can do is maybe distort their shapes a little bit, right? The electrons can kinda slightly move a little bit closer to the positive charge. We call that the electron. Instead of now being, let's say, more or less spherical, symmetric about this positive charge. Maybe it moves a little bit in this direction. So we can imagine that there's a very, very slight distortion in the positions of the electrons occupy. Now there's a higher probability, there'll be actually a little bit closer to the positive charge. And so we call these induced dipole moments. So now there's a dipole moment because the positive and negative charges have been separated slightly. That's an insulator or a dielectric material. The amount of polarization is something that we capture with a dielectric constant. Epsilon. Epsilon tells us how given two materials of material, one, the electrons are a little bit freer to move and they end up polarizing more. We capture that with epsilon. That material has a higher epsilon or permittivity than another material where the electrons are very rigid and they can't move at all, right? Permittivity, it could be very low. Yes, if you put enough energy, we should be able to eventually make videos. If you put enough energy in, yes, you can rip this material apart. That's what happened when we were talking about the capacitors, right? With two capacitors, with a, two plates. If we put enough voltage between these plates, the electric field is so strong that it starts ripping these electrons out. And so yeah, you can eventually make, turn this into a conductor. But you need a very high And that's the, that's called a dielectric breakdown voltage. So typical materials, you know, it's 1 million v/m, give or take to do that. So high voltages are really fun. You get to see a lot of interesting physics happening. If you guys are interested in high voltages. There's a YouTube channel you should check out. What is it called? I'm blanking out. Remember it is second. Electro boom, electrical, hilarious guy. Really cool stuff. Okay. So what is a semiconductor? We just said in a conductor, the electrons are free to move around. Parents are very permissive. Yeah, go, go play. I don't care. In an insulator, the parents are very strict. Nope. You can't leave the house. What's a semiconductor? Somewhere in-between, right? Not so permissive. Well actually in a semiconductor, the permissive parents are, depends on other conditions like the temperature. If it's really hot out. Sure. Go out and play. If it's called. Nope, you can't go. So if you look at an insulator, you can make it hot and you can make it cold. Nope, electrons aren't leaving. If you look at a conductor, doesn't matter how hot it is. Electrons are free to move around. Of course, we're simplifying things a little bit. In a semiconductor, you find something very interesting. If it gets hot enough, all of a sudden it turns into a conductor. Somehow, temperature plays a role. Basically, what a semiconductor is, is it's not as strict. It's not forcing the electrons to be in bonds with as much energy as it is in an insulator so that the electrons are still involved in a bond and a semiconductor, but it doesn't take that much energy to pull them out. And temperature is one way to pull them out because temperature is really just how much jiggling is happening inside the conductor. If the crystal is vibrating, then every once in a while one of the electrons is lucky enough, it gets enough energy in this vibrational collision, and it pops free and it becomes a conductor. So it's semiconductor is not as good as a conductor. So I would call it a semiconductor because the charges are not, the number of free charges is much, much less. In a good conductor for every atom, there's one or two charges that are free to move about, right? Thinking about Avogadro's number, That's a lot of free charges. In a semiconductor, we are talking about orders and orders of magnitude, fewer charges that are free to move around. Yes. Yeah, that's a good question. So with if you take the voltage, pass the dielectric breakdown and then bring it back, does it go back to the previous state? Well, it depends a lot on what the material is. Some materials will return back and behave properly. Other materials you make chemically alter some organic chemical by putting a high enough voltage, you could actually change the chemistry so that it becomes something else. It's no longer a solid, becomes some kind of maybe it's a crystal, it turns into a polycrystalline structure. So you can change the structure. Besides temperature. Very good question. So in a semiconductor, temperature is one way to alter the conductivity. The other way is to, it's a good business. They don't have a good analogy for it. Okay? It's terrible analogy, but I'll make the analogy anyway. So let's say the reason that those Y, Let's say we ask, why are you guys so strict? Why don't you let your kids play? And they say, You know what? We don't let our kids play because to run the house, we need to kids around all the time. You have to clean that the cook. They have to do all this stuff. That's why our kids have to stay home. Then you go talk to the conductors, say why do you let your kids go out? I don't need them. They're bothering me. I want them to go out. I'm good. Everything's taken care of. So my semiconductor, the carrots are like, Yeah, we need the kids to be around, but yeah, I need to be here. So how do you make a semiconductor? More alkalotic, more like a conductor will out of all the neighbors. Let's say one of the neighbors, instead of having two kids, has three kids, then that neighbour is going to say, you know, in this community, it looks like I need to have two kids working in the house to run things. So my extra third kid, he can go out and play. That's it. That's actually how I semiconductor works. If we dope, we call this doping. We introduce another kind of atom into the crystal where it has more electrons which are free. It has more electrons than the others. Then the electrons that need to form bonds right? There gonna be bound. They can't move. But there'll be an extra electron that can go out and be free and that can take place in conduction. Okay? So we can selectively alter the properties of a semiconductor chemically by introducing other materials. Okay, Good question is, can we make a semiconductor as good as a conductor? You can make it nearly as good as conductor, yes. Good questions. Alright. So either these are real questions or I'm going too fast. I don't know. Now that we know what a conductor is, let's talk about this sphere again. So I want to know how much energy does it take to charge up the sphere. And I'll do the calculation quickly because not all of you guys have, have the background and the physics. So for those of you who haven't taken physics yet, you might not follow all the details. So I'll just gloss over them. So first of all, because a conductor, the electrons are free to move about. The electrons are actually going to spread out. Kinda by symmetry. A reason that the electrons are going to spread out uniformly into like a shell, right? They're all going to be as far apart as possible. They're not going to bunch up in any one particular location. They're all going to spread out. Right? And it turns out that this is a spherically symmetric situation in which I can model all the electrons as one big lump of charge, a point charge in the center, having a charge q. And this is something you can derive in electrostatics. So I can do the calculation by just assuming that I have a charge of q. Let's call this radius a. So to calculate how much extra, how much energy does it take to bring a unit of charge up to the sphere that already has a charge of q. Then all I need to do is integrate. So basically the amount of work, Let's say I have a little delta charge of Q. I want to know how much energy does it take to bring this onto the sphere? The electric field, which is the gradient of the potential minus grading of the potential. Tells me the force is q times E. This is the force I feel at any given point. And if I integrate this force from 0.1 to 0.2, That's the amount of work involved, right? Not all of you guys can follow the details because you haven't had the class, electrostatics class. How many people could could do this calculation? And 15 min, 5 min. Okay. So you just raise your hand. Can you come and do it? Just kidding. All right. Alright. So can I do it as a question? So if you remember from basic electrostatics, the potential of a charge q. Let's define the origin of the coordinate system. This is the origin. Then the potential in free space, there would be epsilon zero here of a charge is q over r. And you might think, where did this equation come from? This equation actually comes from the fact that experimentally we know the force goes like one over r squared, right? Hello, I'm measured the force he found like it was one over r-squared. So if I have one over r and I take the derivative, I get one over r-squared. So the potential is one over R. So basically it comes down to integrating. If I want to find the energy is q times phi, right? If I want to integrate this delta Q, there's a charge Q already there. Again, without doing the math, you can kinda see that this is going to be, let me do this. In the, basically this is a volume integral, it's symmetric. So what really matters is, doesn't matter what angle you're coming in at. It doesn't matter. All that matters is where you end up. And so then you just end up with one integral which tells you what radius are you at. So as you're far away, if you're infinitely far away, there's no work involved. As you come in, you have to do work. The closer you get, the more work you have to do the work increases like one over r and you end up at a position a. So this is the potential. And we actually need the force, not the potential. So what we need is minus the gradient. So this gives us the R-squared. And when I do this integral, again, I'm just going to be loose here. Factor of epsilon naught is going to come out a factor of r, The minus two when I integrate, it just becomes one over r. And I'm going over limits from minus infinity to a. And so you can see here that at the end of the day, this is going to be one-half CV squared. And if you solve this equation, What's important? I totally screwed up the calculation. But what's important is to note that this radius is what matters. The bigger the radius, the more capacity you have to store charge. Alright, should have actually done that calculation before class. So we've talked about the bus analogy, we talked about ground. Okay, so up until now, we've been talking about the capacitance of just like a plate or a sphere or a bus. But we're actually more interested usually in talking about the capacitance between conductors. So what is the capacitance between this structure between these two conductors now the deaf, the only thing that changes is that this is my reference. Okay? So the idea is I'm going to take a delta Q of charge and somehow put it over here. Well, when I take a delta Q of charge from one conductor and move it to the other conductor. What stays behind? A minus delta Q of charge, right? Because the first conductor was charged neutral. If I take charge out of it, it becomes charged negatively, right? I took positive charge and take it to the plate. I'll call this the plus plate of the charge. The minus plate of the charge. So as I take positive charge from one conductor and move it to the other conductor, I'm charging one positively and by definition, I'm charging the other negatively. I can do the same calculation for how much energy is involved. The question is, now the calculation should depend on more dimensions, right? We, we kinda saw that the physical size of this conductors important. But why is this dimension important? What do you think? If I make this distance bigger? Should the capacitance go up or down? Okay, most of you will then think about your parallel plate capacitor and say, Oh yeah, I was proportional to the area of the plates, but inversely proportional to the distance between the plates. Why is it that bringing the conductors in close together reduces the capacitance, increases the capacitance. Actually. Let's actually think about this problem. Let's say we have two plates. And I'm going to charge this up to 1 v, right? So some positive charge is going to be deposited onto the top plate. And the negative charge is going to be deposited on the bottom plate. And I'm interested in knowing how the capacitance changes with this dimension t, the distance between the plates. So if I bring the plates really far apart from each other, does the capacitance go up or down? It goes down. Why is that? Well, if you think about capacitance as really a unit of energy, right? Q is CV. It's the capacity to store charge. It's telling you how much energy does it take to take a unit of charge and put it onto this plate? Well, if these charges remember, like charges repel. So it all comes down to how much charge I was already on the plate. Right. In a situation where I just had a single plate, it only depends on how big the plate was. But now it also depends on how far away the other plate is, because the other plate has minus charge on it. If I take these two together as a unit, What's their net charge? Zero, they kind of cancel each other out. So in this situation, all these charges together are kind of canceling each other out and making it much easier for me to bring on a new unit of charge. In fact, if I wanted to get really good cancellation, what would I do? I'd put the plates really close together like paper like paper thin close, right? If I put the plates really close together, then all the positive charges are going to be here. All the negative charges are going to be here. And they're going to pretty much all cancel each other out. And so then to bring in another unit of charge, delta q is really easy and the capacitance goes up. So bring the plates close together, increases the capacitance. Okay. Any questions? Alright. Exactly. Very good point. Yeah. So this is exactly why it's difficult to build, to store a lot of energy in a capacitor because you know, that company that sells at 159 microfarad capacitor, whatever it was. Of course, they want to make more money the more capacity they can give you, the more they can charge for that capacitance. So you can imagine that they're going to take the thinnest possible film and put two conductors right next to each other to try to get the highest capacitance that can. Well, you can only play that game so much because if you put the plates too close together, then the electrons could just jump from one plate to the other, right? There's just no way to insulate them. You need to be able to have a barrier to prevent electrons from going from one plate to the other. And that's exactly why the breakdown voltage goes down as you put them closer and closer together because there's, the electrical breakdown happens at a certain field. Let's say it's 1 million v/m. Well, things are just a micron of Paul, the part 1 v. We'll break it down, right? Very good point. Okay, so here I just wanted to make the point that it's not like a double decker bus has twice the capacity, right? Double decker bus for people has twice the capacity. But for a capacitor it can have much higher capacitance because of the cancellation between the plus and minus charges. Again, don't really need to review this. I think most of you guys remember that for a parallel plate capacitor, it's proportional to the area of the plates divided by T. T is the separation between the plates. And now hopefully you have a much better idea of why the capacitance depends on physical dimensions. This epsilon factor here depends on the material between these plates. If we assume that it's free space, it's air, it's roughly the dielectric constant of free-space. If you're a physicist, you would just say this is one. You say, oh, speed of light is one, epsilon is one, mu is one. Let's be done with it. But in MKS units, this is 8.854 times ten to the -12 farads per meter. It's been burned into my head. This is how you build capacitors. Again, high density capacitors. Take conductors, put them as close together as you can, roll them up together. So you can imagine here sheets and sheets of conductor or dielectric conductor, dielectric conductor, dielectric roll together. And this gives you a nice linear capacitor. If you fill, instead of using a film. If you actually use some kind of electrolyte which has very high polarization. Again, we won't go into the details of that. Then you can build a even bigger capacitor. But the problem is that it has to only be charged in one direction. So electrolytes, electrolytic capacitors will have a little plus symbol saying you have to charge it in this direction, otherwise it's going to blow up on you. In integrated circuits, we also build capacitors by just taking advantage of the fact that modern technology gives us the ability to build very, very tiny structures and put things very, very close together. So we build these structures. We have these interdigitated capacitors with the metal conductors sitting sub microns apart, like 10 nm apart from each other. So we can build a very nice large inductor capacitor in an integrated circuit process. The problem is though, that I won't get into the details here, but again, there's breakdown voltage limitations and all that stuff as well. Okay. So we're at 11 is a good place to stop. See you all Thursday.
