All right. Okay, Good morning class. Today we're going to be starting on module three. Just kind of loosely calling these different modules. I gave up on giving lecture numbers because we're running a little bit on a different schedule. So module three is a little bit different from what we've been doing so far. It's more about devices and their physics and applications of RC circuits. So hopefully it's a chance to sit back, sit back and relax and maybe learn something new about technology. So let's dive in. So we're going to start out today by giving you an introduction to transistors. Obviously, it takes more than one course to actually understand how transistors work at the physical level. We're gonna give you a very simple model of the transistor and kind of abstract away the details, but that's what we do in engineering. You can't understand everything at any given point. If you're working on a project, you can understand every sub-component and you have to abstract and understand, okay, what's my model, What's my viewpoint? What's my interface to that component? That's what I need to understand. Once we have a transistor, we can talk about logic gates. And some of you have taken 61 C and you know how to build different logic gates out of transistors. For those of you who don't, you know, it's not really the point here will give you a couple of quick examples. The point is to show that once you have logic gates, they're switching speed is actually limited by their intrinsic capacitance and resistance of the transistor. And so we'll actually be able to apply our RC circuits directly to this particular application and show that that's the maximum rate at which you can switch it a logic circuit. Similarly, what we'll look at how transistors behave as amplifiers, and in particular will kind of show that inside of every op-amp, there's a transistor and it's capacitance and its trans-conductance are what limit the frequency response and the trans conductance of an amplifier is very much related to the concept of resistance will come. We'll look at that in some detail. So you might wonder like op-amps are great. We use them all over the place. Why not use them for every application? Well, it turns out that there's a limit and how fast you can switch an op-amp or have an op-amp processes circuit. There's a limit and how fast it responds. We say it has a frequency limit. And that's really determined by the transistor. The transistors inside. In the lab this week, you guys have already started looking at analog and digital converters. There's also a homework problem on it. I'm just going to flash through that really quickly. No pun intended if you know what a flash ADC converter is. That joke is like just went over everyone's head. Never mind. Again. The point of this last bullet point. This is the last bullet point which is important. Again, ADCs and DAX are very important and their speed is ultimately limited by capacitances and resistances, which we'll talk about. Okay, so now we're gonna talk about transistors. This is not quite a transistor. This is a mosque capacitor. Moss stands for metal oxide silicon. So if you think of a normal capacitor, like how do you build a normal capacitor? With a normal capacitor, we have some kind of insulator. And you've put a conductor here. And we put another conductor here, right? This is our simple parallel plate capacitor that we know and love. So a mos capacitor, of course, this conductor, we can call that metal the insulator. We can call it an oxide, because silicon dioxide, for instance, which is quartz sand, is a really good insulator. It's glass goes by many different names. So that's why this is called an oxide here, because this is the, the oxide of silicon, silicon dioxide. And here instead of putting another conductor, we're going to put a semiconductor. In fact, we're gonna put silicon for the most part. This is gonna be silicon dioxide. And this can be either a metal or it can be something that acts like a conductor, can be actually a piece of semiconductor that's modified to act like a conductor. But the important point is this MOS structure, metal oxide silicon. Now. So basically here we're going to erase this. And we're going to bring in the semiconductor here. Now, if we go back to a couple of lectures ago, we were talking about metals versus insulators versus semi conductors. Conductors, as you may remember, have lots of free carriers. Usually electrons basically whirling about the structure and they respond to electric fields. Basically they're not bound to any bonds like they are in insulators. Insulators those electrons are all forming bonds with their neighbors. And maybe they can exchange places with their neighbors, but they're always bound. They can't freely move about the, let's say the structure, the crystal that they're in. Now semiconductors, we said, are similar to insulators in that they also have, their conductors are electrons more or less bound and covalent bonds, but not as tightly. And under the right conditions, you can loosen some of those electrons and turn them into conductors. Basically. Some of those conditions are like you can increase the temperature. If you make the temperature higher, the crystals vibrating more. And some of these electrons will just randomly gain enough energy from the crystal and free themselves and then they can move around the crystal. You can also play other tricks. Another trick is called doping. Doping is something that athletes shouldn't do, but it's very good for semiconductors to do. You basically, instead of like let's say we're building silicon. As you may know, silicon has four valence electrons. If you take a material that has five valence electrons, right? Go look on the periodic table, group five element, five valence electrons, and introduce that into the silicon at very low quantities, right? So the number of, we know that there's Avogadro number of atoms inside of a centimeter cubed, right? The ten to the 22 atoms per centimeter cubed. We're talking about like introduce ten to the 15 or ten to the 18th and the one-thousandth power per centimeter cube. So relatively small doping compared to the intrinsic doping of the atoms. But every time you put in a group five element, it has an extra electron, which it doesn't need. That group five element needs four electrons to form its covalent bonds. But that fifth electron becomes free and it can move about the crystal. So you could actually modulate the conductivity of a semiconductor by doping it. Okay? Now, again, looking at this structure here. We know that for a normal capacitor, the charge that's stored is just proportional to the voltage that we put a cross here, right? So if I put a voltage v here, then I know that the charge is just proportional. For MOS structure. Something very interesting happens. First of all, you shouldn't expect it to work at all. You should say this is not a capacitor, right? It's just one single conductor. You need two conductors, right? To establish a voltage reference. Whereas the second terminal, right? It could be similar that sphere capacitor we talked about. But there we had to establish the reference at ground or at infinity. This is not a two terminal element. So when we talk about this voltage between here and here, how do we establish this voltage, right? Usually we connect a voltage source. But if charge can't go in and out of this material, if this is a semiconductor, then how is it going to establish this voltage, right? It's just not going to work. But what we find is it almost works. All you have to do is make the voltage large enough. We say that this device has a threshold voltage. If you exceed the threshold voltage, VT, then all of a sudden it starts acting like a capacitor. If you're below the threshold voltage. No, nothing happens, no charge. And that's very different. So explaining the physics of that, of course, is going to take a lot of work and we're not gonna do that, we're going to abstract that away. But the threshold voltage is something unique to semiconductors. And a simple way of thinking about it is if you make a very strong electric field, in fact, the way that you build a real transistor to get a reasonable threshold voltage. You put the silicon really close to this gate. We call this the gate to this top terminal. And if I put the silicon really, really close and I separate it with silicon dioxide. So this is my insulator. We're talking, let's say ten. Let's say 1 nm. Let's say 10 nm. So we're talking about a very, very thin sheet of insulator. That means that when you apply a voltage onto the gate and you put plus charges onto the gate, you are creating a very, very large electric field. And that very, very large electric field is so large that it can change the dynamics of what's happening inside the semiconductor. So usually in the semiconductor, all the electrons want to be in the bond, bonded state. But here we have such a strong electric field that we're changing the dynamics and actually freeing some electrons and allowing those electrons to basically accumulate. I shouldn't say accumulate because it has a technical meaning. But from a nontechnical sense, we could say electrons accumulate under the gate and essentially form the second plate of our capacitor. So we're switching the semiconductor from a non conductor to a conductor in the region under the gate, only under the gate to everywhere else. The conditions are as they were before and there's not enough electrons around. Okay, So why is that important? Well, capacitors, usually we're not interested in building capacitors. Usually we're interested in building transistors. So what is a transistor? Transistor? The way we'd like to, what we're after is really a switch. So here is like a mechanical switch, electromechanical switch, or even a mechanical switch. A switch has two states. It has an often on-state, right? Depending on where there's either a conductor connecting the two poles of the switch, right? Or you open up and there's nothing. And how you do this, you can do it mechanically, you can do it basically turn a knob or a switch or, you know, some mechanical way or even an electromagnet. So this is the structure that we're trying to build now are, if we look at our this, we'll call this the gate. We call it the gate because it gates what happens, right? It determines if there's a channel. We'll call these electrons that form over here. We'll call this the channel. The gate determines how conductive the channel is. So you can imagine if I could somehow put a wire here and a wire here and apply a voltage between these two wires. Right? Then current. I want current to flow, I want current to flow through this transistor. Depending on the state of the gate. Over here, current will flow. If the gate is closed, right? If you close the gate, then current can flow through this structure. Similar thing here with the transistor. If I'm below the threshold voltage, then there are no conductors underneath the gate, right? There's basically it's a semiconductor. It acts like an insulator and no current can flow. If, on the other hand, the gate voltage is higher than the threshold voltage, then there's conductors underneath the gate and they form a channel that connects one side of the device to the other side of device. So now we can actually conduct current from one side of the device, so the other, so it acts like a switch. It's a little bit different from a switch in the sense that it doesn't have two states. Switch has just an on and off state. Here we have a continuum of states. Once we exceed the threshold voltage, below the threshold voltage, it's off. And we can, for all intents and purposes in this class say no current flows. Once we exceed the threshold voltage, we control how conductive the channel is. Because remember, Q is equal to C times V minus VT, the threshold voltage. So the higher the gate voltage is, the more conductive the channel, the more current that can flow. Okay? Any questions at this point? I know this is kinda new material to a lot of people, so it could be confusing. Very good question, excellent question. Is the threshold voltage a property of the material or does also depend on the other voltages in the structure. That's a really good question. For now. Let's just say it's a property of the material. It does depend weakly on some of the other voltages, like what voltage you put in the body. It's called the body effect. But no, let's just assume for now that threshold voltages are given. When I give you a transistor, one of the first questions you should ask is what is its threshold voltage? And I'll say it's half a volt or volt. And that means that that's a property of the transistor. Great question. Any other questions? Yes. Yeah, That's also a good question. So let's look at this structure. I take these things for granted because I've been working with him for 20 plus years. This is the gate. The gate is the top conductor. So let me write that down. Whoops. Now, down here, what we're going to do is instead of putting just one contact, we're going to put two contexts. So let me redraw this. So a transistor actually has three terminals and we can think of it at the switch, the way to think about it as like a switch. So you have your gate. The gate is on top and it's a conductor, just call it a metal. Then here we have our semiconductor. And what I wanna do is put two connections on the sides. So in total, I have three terminals with a transistor. You think about it, a switch. We don't think of it as a three terminal element. We think of a switch as a two terminal element. But there is also that third terminal which is controlling because this is now an electronic switch. There's a third terminal that controls whether the gate is open or closed, right? So very simple. When a model for this could be like a valve. You have a pipe, right? Water flows in from one side. And how much of the water makes it to the other side depends on how closed or open the valve is. If you close the valve, no water can flow. You're physically blocking the water from flowing. Let's draw like the valve. Let's draw a simple analogy here. So this is the gate. And I can move this up and down, right? If I move it all the way down, I'm blocking the flow of water. No current can flow. As I move this gate up. Then some water can flow. And the further up I move it, the more and more water can flow until I reached the top, but which it's kinda saturated and that's the maximum current that can flow through this. So very similar thing is happening over here. So we can see that it's three terminals. We need to give names to these terminals. And the names that we give these terminals, we're going to call this one the source. We're going to call this one the drain. Is it symmetrical? Yes, it is most needed. The device itself is symmetrical. We're just going to name one side, the source. Name the other side the drain. And in fact, if you look at this picture, you might say, Well, you named them backwards because the source should be the source of the water, right. And the drain should be the drain of the water. I'll come back to your question in a minute. Why did I draw it backwards? Well, it's because of those pesky electrons. They have negative charge. So when electrons move to the right, the current actually moves to the left. So the source is the source of the electrons. They come in, they flow through our device and then we say they drain out the drain side. So the drain side is at a higher potential than the source side if electrons are flowing through the device. Okay? So let me write, I wrote it down. So then we have three terminals here, source, gate, and drain. I think there was a question. Yeah. Yeah. The question is with a valve, you can control how much water gets through, right? How conductive the pipe is. With a transistor. You can do the same thing with the transistor. You can also control how much current flows. And that's why a transistor is different from a normal switch. So if you wanted to give a very simple model of a switch, you would say it's a transistor that starts the transistor as a switch. But really it's not a switch. It's more like this valve and allergy. Okay. So this is kinda my cartoon cross section of a drawing I should have mentioned. We're drawing cross-sections here, and this is an actual transistor. Let's zoom in and look at it. So down here is the semiconductor fact. I'll just call it silicon because that's what it is. This is the silicon, this is the gate. And here you can see how thin it is. What is that red line? That's the silicon dioxide. It's so thin that it barely shows up. And that's basically, you know, in today's technology. It's actually so thin. It's usually just like tens of atoms thick. Because as you'll learn later on, if you follow this, if you pursue the path of physical electronics, the larger you can make this capacitance, the better. And so people have, you know, as, as you scale the device smaller and smaller, you have to make this capacitance also bigger. And so that's why people have scaled the oxide from microns down to who, you know, tens of nanometers which we have today. So in this picture, this is the source and drain and someone said, Is it symmetric? You can see from this picture that indeed it's symmetric. The source and drain look the same, right? And this is how we actually make a contact into these, into the source and drain of the device. This is where the channel is going to form. Highlight that. That's actually too big. The channel is going to more or less form at the surface of the structure. So I'm gonna get a channel over here. And the electrons are going to flow along this channel very, very close to the gate. And then on top of this we've got lots of metal layers. These are just for interconnectors and wiring. Silicon, integrated circuit technology is a street was extremely successful because with one process, you could build your transistors and all your wiring together. And if we look at history and if you look at pictures of old computers with wires flying everywhere to spaghetti mess crazy. You can imagine 16 a imagine you had to debug a simple circuit on a breadboard with maybe 20 wires. Now imagine building a computer with thousands of wires, right? With physical wires. And imagine how easy it is to make a mistake. Imagine how easy it is to accidentally pull a wire off. Imagine if one wire fails, how difficult that is to figure out where that wire is to fix it. So once integrated circuit manufacturing was introduced, it was a game changer because now you could build thousands and thousands, of course millions and today billions of transistors all sitting on the same substrate simultaneously in one shot. And you can connect them all together in various complicated ways with these metal layers which are grown right on top. And they're physically bound. They're like they're not wires, they're not loose. They're actually physical, solid structures that connect, right? They're not loose. So here we have these various layers that are separated by silicon dioxide. And in fact, what made silicon such an important choice as a semiconductor was that it has a native oxide. And this native oxide can be used both to grow these insulating layers and also as part of the process of making the transistors. So we could use this, the native oxide to block doping. Remember earlier I talked about how we need to introduce dopants into the structure. We're actually going to inject dopends externally. And we want to photolithography. Photolithography to define like little windows where those dopants go. Those are actually what are these diffusion regions that are shown over here? Those regions are little bit different from the rest of the silicon because they have the dopants present. And to create those regions require it or to create these transistors, right? You have to define where the gate is. This is a tiny transistor, right? This is like 0.1 microns by 0.2 microns. You're not going to go in there and, you know, by hand, shave off a little piece of silicon dioxide to say, Okay, this is my opening. Even if you could do that, You're not going to build 1 million transistors that way, right? Photolithography, let's us use a mask, a photo mask, and use light. We shine light on the surface of the silicon. And we basically use materials which are sensitive to light, which chemically alter so we can polish away. We can basically use acids to wash off parts of the material that have been exposed to light. So that's a very, very quick introduction on how we build these things. Obviously, you don't have to understand at all. But the point I want to get across to you is that even in a very old technology, and this is an ancient technology note I'm showing you here. The picture is nice and pretty because it's, things are big, relatively big. The scale is five microns. Remember this is five times ten to the minus six. And just to put that, put that in perspective, how thick is a piece of human hair? 0.1 mm or 100 microns, right? Depends on how thick your hair is. I probably have quite thick here. But if you have thin here, maybe it's 30 microns. So if a typical hair thickness is 100 microns, right? This is 20 times smaller than the thickness of a hair. This dimension here. So you can see that this is actually a quite a big transistor by today's standards. Because the way we do critical dimension, the transistor is the length of the channel. So we can see in this picture, this is a very, very big transistor because it has like five microns from the drain to the source. You know, today's transistors or 1,000 times smaller. But if I showed you that cross-section, you wouldn't be able to see the transistor because it's so convoluted looking with all the different layers and materials. I think there was a question and yeah, It's made during the process and that's the beauty of silicon dioxide is that you don't have to use a separate process to kind of attach that insulator. You can just grow it natively, right? All you have to do is turn up the temperature flow and some oxygen, and you get a nice clean oxide layer. Silicon dioxide is an extremely good insulator, very stable material. So if we look at this picture now, this is a little bit more realistic of what a transistor looks like. You can see the three terminals, the gate to drain, the source. There is a fourth terminal that we're going to ignore. It is the body of the transistor. And this critical dimension, which is, this is basically to take this dimension and to make it like a factor of 0.7 smaller, or let's just say reduce this dimension requires billions of dollars of investment, right? This is, this is what's been driving Moore's law. This is why transistors have gotten smaller and smaller by reducing this critical dimension. And today this dimension is smaller than the wavelength of light. So the techniques that they're using to create this, it's a lot of interesting technology that's gone into creating this and making Moore's Law possible. And we'll find out in today's lecture why this dimension is so important. So we've been looking at the cross-section of transistors, and let's look at a top, top-down picture of a transistor. So top-down picture of a transistor looks like this. Have our source, we have our drain. Those are those diffusion regions. Then we're going to have our gate. So this is the gate on top. This is the channel length of the device. This is the width of the device. Now the width of the device, if we think of this as like a resistor, right there is basically let me just draw one resistor. So it's not confusing. If we just think of the channel as forming a resistor, then what is the channel resistance proportional to? This is our channel. You guys all know this from 168, right? Or your physics course. So yeah, resistivity Rho, so exactly. L over W times some kind of thes t thickness, the thickness of the channel. Well, in integrated circuits, because this thickness is always the same, we group it with the row term and just call this a sheet resistance. So this R-squared, it really is called R-square, is basically ohms per square because I can just look at a layout. You don't have to tell me anything about the physical dimensions. I just need to look at the aspect ratio. By looking at the aspect ratio, I can tell you. Let's say that R-square is a kilo ohms per square. So if something has a square, It's one-kilo. Doesn't matter if it's a tiny square or a huge square. It's still one kiloohm because it's L over W. So this is, we call this the number of squares. So if I told you that the sheet resistance is one kiloohm, What's the resistance of the switch? Anybody want to take a guess? How many squares fit in there? Give me a number. 53, 25. How many squares? Maximize the size of the square, right? And then see how many you can fit. Yeah. 100. Any other guesses? Good. One too. Yeah, I like to. Here's one square. Here's another square, right? That's two squares. Remember it's L over W. So if you look at the dimension L here, this looks like an L, This looks like an L. So W is approximately two L, That's two squares. So the sheet resistance here, actually technically it's one-half squared, right? Because it's L over W. W is wider than L. So the resistance is one-half of a kilo-ohm are about 500 ω, exactly. So that's what a transistor looks like from the top perspective. Obviously, we don't draw these pictures every time we talked about transistors, we have a symbol for them. Just like we have a symbol for resistors and capacitors. This is the symbol for a transistor. Let's focus in over here. Usually the body is not shown. So in every schematic, you will see something like this. Notice that symbol is trying to convey something about the structure. Look at the gate. The gate looks at, it, looks like it's making a capacitor with the line in between the drain and the source, right, with the channel. Because it is, right, That's what the structure is, that's what a transistor is. There's also an arrow in the structure. The arrow, sometimes it's omitted. But if it's there, it's telling you two things. First, that's telling you where the sources so the arrow always appears on the source side. What's the second thing it's telling you? Exactly arrows usually indicate directions. This is the direction of current flow. Remember it's not the electrons. It's basically the reverse direction of the electrons because electrons have minus charge. So here's another symbol for a transistor where basically we're saying Look, source and drain are really symmetric. You can pick one or the other. What determines the source and drain is how you bias up the device. So whichever node is at a higher voltage on a transistor like this, That's the drain. Now, why are there two trends? Why are there four pictures here? Well, it turns out there's two kinds of transistors you can build. There's the transistors that we've been talking about called N mosses. N stands for negative, stands for electrons, meaning the charge carriers are electrons. And then you have your PMOS family. Pmos, p for positive charge. And it's actually a very interesting story. Probably too long to talk about in this class. But when people first started measuring properties of semiconductors, they had a big surprise in store. For instance, you take a piece of silicon, you heat it up, and you measure how much the resistivity changes, right? It goes from insulator to some conductor. And then you have some theory. You use your theory to estimate, okay, at this temperature, how many electrons should be loose? And from that, I can calculate the conductivity. Conductivity depends on the number of free carriers and how fast they move and that fit theory for all this, you work out the theory and you get the right answer, but it's just off by a factor of two, right? It's not annoying. I must have made an error. You go through and you do the calculations again. No. You're not off by basically there's a factor of two missing somewhere. And they searched, and they searched and they search. Until someone clever realized, actually, every time you release an electron, you also released another particle, quasi particle, called a hole. And a hole travels through the silicon. In a very similar way as an electron does. It essentially behaves like a carrier of charge. It has a different mass. It's about twice as heavy as electrons, but it has the same charge as electrons. And again, you might say, well, what is this quasi particle having a mass that's twice? What does that even mean? Again, you need a lot of quantum mechanics and stuff to really understand it. At the end of the day, analogies are great. The analogy of the whole is this. Imagine that I was a very popular lecture, right? What does, this room would be full, right? Everybody, every seat would be taken. Today. There's quite a bit of vacancies. Now, if someone were to get up right halfway through the lecture, they receive an important call. They have to go. Then they get up and they leave, they leave a vacancy behind. The people sitting next to that person might say, You know what, that's a better seat than I have. I'm going to sit there. Maybe their food, they think, oh, that's seat, looks better. They don't realize that the end of the day it's really the same. The view is the same. We've got all these screens, but then they changed positions. Once they move, they create a new vacancy right next to them. And then the person sitting next to them says, Oh, that's a better seat, I'm going to move. And so you can imagine the vacancy can move around. This is what happens in a conductor semiconductor, I should say. When one of the electrons leaves its bonding state, it leaves a little vacancy behind, which has positive charge. And then other nearby electrons which are in bonds, see that they can see a slightly better In terms energetically favorable place to be. And they jump into that vacancy. And that vacancy just travels around the semiconductor until a physical electron that's free encounters the vacancy, and it occupies it and get bound again to the semiconductor. So we say that in the first place when an electron is fried, we create an electron and a hole. This is what we call these particles holes. And the electron and hole can move around until they meet again. If they meet again, they annihilate. Both disappear. So in semiconductors, you can actually set things up so that's energetically favorable for holes to flow. And you can imagine since they have positive charges, all the voltages that we've been talking about has to be flipped around. The drain has to be lower voltage than the source. The gate has to be lower voltage has to be a negative voltage. The threshold voltage is negative. So these devices, they, you know, they're kind of like the complement to the end mosses. We have the PMOS as everything is flipped around. So if we look at the symbol for a PMOS, there's two ways that you can detect that it's a PMOS. One is to notice that the arrow has switched directions. The source is truly the source of holes. Holes flow inside the transistor in this direction. Okay? But if you don't want to show that, if you want to be more symmetric and more fair and say you know what the transistor, the source and drain are just the same. It doesn't matter, it depends on the bias conditions that determines the source and drain. In that case, I'm not going to label I'm not going to put the arrow there, but I still need to show that this is a PMOS. And the notation that we use is a little bubble. I noticed someone in the edX discussion was saying, what the heck is this bubble? This bubble means inversion. It means that instead of a positive voltage to turn on the gate, he need a negative voltage to turn on the gate. You might think, well, you know, my computer doesn't use negative voltages, right? Well, it's a negative relative Voltage, negative relative to the channel. If the channel is at 1 v and you put your gate at 0 v, that's a -1 v negative voltage applied. Okay? So we've talked about this model of a transistor. We talked about the fact that they have polarity. And I want to also just point out that this is a good thing. The fact that we can build two different kinds of transistors in the same technology is a big deal. In fact, my first computer, when I was a kid, the dinosaur ages, right? It only had and mosses. And that computer ran hot. So an n mos only computer would have logic gates that looked like this. So let's, let's look at this logic gate. So this is the input, this is the output and this is a resistor. Let's draw an equivalent circuit. Or equivalent circuit is this is just a switch. So this is the input, the output. Alright, so let's imagine that the switch comes in at 0 v. What does that mean for the switch? The transistor at 0 v, it's an n mos as a threshold voltage, that's, let's say half a volt. So 0 v means the transistor is off. It's an open circuit. So what is the output voltage? Is, what's the output voltage is going to be VDD, Let's say 1 v, right? Let's call this 1 v zeros and ones. On the other hand, let's say that the input voltage is 1 v. 1 v means that the switches on, which means the output is shorted to ground 0 v, right? So the truth table for this device is if we have this as our input, this is our output. If the input is zero, the output is a one. If the inputs are one, the output is a zero. This is also known as an inverter, inverts to very important device. It's at the core of every device. Notice there's a little bubble there and a little buffer symbol. Little triangle. It's like a, it's like a buffer. We'll talk about that more later. The bubble says it inverts. So the output is a buffered copy of the input, except it's inverted. Now why is this bad? I'll give you guys a hint. My first computer, well, my first love, Let's say first computer, my first love was a Commodore 64. The Commodore 64. You playing a really cool game on it halfway through your game, it would just crash and it would get too hot. So people had all sorts of tricks. Like one of the tricks was you could buy a big piece of metal. And you basically would jam this piece of metal inside of the Commodore 64 and make a little cut and touch the microprocessor like you're basically create a huge heat sink so that you could run those cool games and not crash your computer. We also, there was also a pin that would reset the microprocessor, but that pin wasn't soldered. So another cool trick that you would do feel really cool is you would solder this wire to that pin and then take that wire outside of the computer. And that was like a reset button. So when it crashed, you can just reset it. Otherwise you have to unplug it and plug it back in. Okay. Now you guys know how old I am going to answer the initial question which is your resistors are burning off. Uh-huh. Yes. Exactly. The thing, the reason this is bad is that at any given time, half your logic states are going to be in the zero state. And in the zero state, current is flowing. So when this is on, lots of current is flowing through here, right? This might be a kilo-ohm. And so you have a milliamp flowing through here, that's a huge amount of current. If you have 1 million gates, right? That's a kilo amp of current. Kilo amp, write 1,000 amps of current. That's ridiculous. So those early computers, obviously they were, they had to make this resistors bigger than a kilo-ohm. Resistor is take up a lot of area of the bigger you make them, the physically bigger they need to be. So you can only make them so thin, defined by lithography. So to make them bigger, you have to make them longer. And so you have to build these huge resistors to limit the amount of current through these devices, but they burned current. Now once p mos Technology came around, when we were able to marry n mos devices plus PMOS devices. We created cmos. Cmos was a game changer because now I can build my inverter out of two transistors. Transistors. This is the transistor could be made smaller than the resistor. So that meant that smaller, more transistors per unit area, right? That was exciting. But let's look at how this device works. So basically we're taking an n mos transistor and we're stacking a PMOS transistor on top of it. Again, this is our input, this is our output. So why do we love this? Well, let's go through and do the same truth table kind of calculation. Let's put 0 v in here. Okay? So if I put 0 v, this device is off. It's below the threshold voltage. But look at the top device. What's the voltage from the gate to the source of the device? The gates at 1 v, the sources at 0 v. So the gate to source voltage is minus one volts. The negative voltage. And the PMOS device has a threshold voltage of, let's say, minus half a volt. So the PMOS device turns on. So if we were to draw the equivalent circuit, we have a device that's on, a device that's off. So the output voltage, just like before, is 1 v. Because that's very similar to what we had with the resistor. Except instead of having a resistor pulling us up, sometimes called the pull up resistor. We have a transistor that pulls us up. So this one is off because this has 0 v, this has a full -1 v on it. Let's look at the second case. Let's put a 1 v here. Now. If I put 1 v, then this transistor actually turns on. And now if I look at this device, I have 1 v here, I have 1 v here. That means I have 0 v across this device. Not enough to turn it on. It's not negative, it's positive at zero. So this second transistor is going to turn off. This transistor is now on because there's 1 v here. This transistor turns off because there's 0 v and the output gets pulled down to ground 0 v. So the truth table is the same as before. Here's the input, here's the output, 0110. It inverts. Again. This is the symbol for an inverter. But notice that in either state, you always have an open circuit between supply and ground. So it never conducts current in steady-state, right? In either state, it's basically either 0 v or the VDD, but there's no conducting path between the supply and ground, so no current flows, which means that it doesn't burn any static power. Yes. Well, the, the transistor itself doesn't really have a truth table. Write the logic gate has a truth table transistor itself. You could abstract it to a device having a truth table. And if you wanna do it that way, but you need to take the threshold voltage into account, right? You would say, well, if the voltage is above the threshold voltage, I'm going to say the transistors on, it's below the threshold voltage. I'm going to say it's off. And Moss has a positive threshold voltage, PMOS as a negative threshold voltage. Okay, that's a good question. So what if this, what if this is driving something, right? So it turns out that it's actually a very good question. Usually we end up driving other gates. So very common scenario is for one logic gate to drive another logic gate, maybe this one's bigger. So the question is, how does this load this logic gate? Well, let's actually just draw the schematic and see. So I have basically the same circuit twice. And now this is my input and this is my output. By the way, what's the what's the truth table for this device? What's the what is the purpose of this device? What? Yeah. Yeah, input, output are the same, right? If you put in a zero outcomes, zero if you put an a one, outcomes are one. Because if you don't see that, just think about it. If I put a zero here, I'm gonna get one volts over here. And then 1 v will turn on this transistor, which will produce, produce a zero at the output. Okay? You'll notice that I'm a little bit fast with my notation. So I'm going to slow down and go back and actually tell you that this is a PMOS. Usually it's just obvious by contexts, but let's just be explicit here. So you might wonder this is a useless device, right? And it has a symbol. The symbol is just that. There's no bubble because it doesn't invert. But it's actually quite useful because it's what we call a buffer. It can help one circuit drive another circuit. How that's possible. We'll get to by the end of today's lecture why that's important. But let me go back to your question which was, how does this Logic gate number two, load logic gate number one. Well, what's the what is it? What do you see when you look into the gate of the transistor? Remember our transistors and MOS, metal oxide silicon structure. So we're looking at on the metal side, you see a conductive path to ground. Looking from the top of the transistor, you're seeing the top plate of the capacitor. What does that look like? It looks like a capacitor, right? So basically the way that these transistors, if I were to draw an equivalent circuit. I realize now, well, my equivalent circuit was just a switch before. But let me make the model a little bit more realistic. First of all, what's the resistance? What's the on-resistance of a switch? 0 ω. Does our transistor really have 0 ω? I put 1 v here. What do I actually have? Well, unless you're dealing with some superconductor, it's not zeros. Remember its sheet resistance times the aspect ratio of the device number squares. So the on-resistance is certainly not zero. Let's say for a typical square root of ice, it's about a kilo-ohm, ten kilohms. So that's important. Because even though in this static circuit, it may not matter, right? If this is the end monsters on, then this is our onto ground. The output is still ground. It's just being pulled to ground by resistor. It doesn't matter that there's a resistor there. There's no current flowing through the resistor is not doing anything. But then when you think about one transistor, driving another transistor, you realize a hot, the resistance does matter. Because if I have resistance and capacitance, I have an RC circuit. So let's, let's look at that in a little more detail. Let's redraw the equivalent circuit. But now let's take into account that your transistor model should have an on-resistance. We'll call this ROP. We'll call this RON. Well, let's just assume that they're actually the same. Because usually when you build these devices, you control the width of this transistors. You actually physically draw on a computer screen, you to determine what the width of the transistor is gonna be. And usually people select the width of the PMOS device to be twice the width of the n mos device. Because if you do that, the fact that holes are about twice as heavy equalizes, right? Usually when holds her twice as heavy means the device is going to be twice as resistive. But by making the PMOS device twice as big as the n mos, you cancel that factor out and then the NMOS and PMOS have roughly the same on-resistance. So here's 1 v, here's ground. Whoops, I need to put in the switch. And so in this picture, I have an n mos that's on a PMOS that's off. Let's hook that up to another inverter. So the output now is going to control these transistors. And in this case, if this is 0 v, this would turn off. And this one would produce a negative voltage and turn on. Now I have these arrows kinda magically pointing to the other transistor action at a distance, I'm telling you I'm 1 v, I'm above your threshold voltage turned on, right? That's not how they work, right? How they work is they actually are connected to capacitors. We call this C gate to source capacitance between the gate terminal and the source terminal and the gate terminals are tied together. So this is the gate terminal and this capacitor is intrinsic to the device. It's a part of the device. You can't get rid of it. It's there. So in this case, the first inverter is driving second inverter. And the way that the second inverter loads the first inverter is with capacitance. And you look at this circuit and you say, I recognize this circuit. It's an RC circuit. So as an RC circuit, I know that things don't switch instantaneously. If one transistor turns on, the output is not going to instantaneously go to ground. It's going to settle to ground with an exponential characteristic time constant related to the resistance and the capacitance of the circuit. If you want to go fast, you want that tau RC time constant to be a smallest possible. So you want to have the smallest resistance possible and the smallest capacitance possible. And this is why shrinking the device dimensions has been instrumental in not only making more transistors per unit area, but also giving us the ability to switch transistors faster and faster. Anybody want to guess how fast my first love could switch? This is circa 1984, 85 technology, right? What was the CPU clock speed? Omega, right on the money, 1 mhz, exactly. So more than 1,000 times slower than what we have today. Okay? We have our model of a transistor as a switch so that the salient features are, there's gotta be on resistance. There's our source, There's our fits an n mos, I'll do it over here. And then our gate has capacitance, which we're gonna call CGS, PMOS. Let's draw the equivalent circuit for a PMOS device. Now the source is on top, the drain is on top. And we have our gate here, and we also have CGS. Now the only If you look at these, they're almost the same, right? I just flipped one over. They look the same. There's nothing different. The only difference is that this has a threshold voltage, which is positive. And this has a threshold voltage which is negative. This is a PMOS. This is an n mos. Alright, so this is our digital picture of transistors is actually a pretty, pretty darn good picture of transistors. You could get away with this model for the rest of your life if you've just never really thought about, never, ever want to deal with transistors again, you just need a model to work with. This RC model will get you very far. You can analyze tons of problems and feel very good about your knowledge of transistors. You know something about the physics, you know where CGS comes from, that scaling the dimensions of W and L change the Oran and they also changed the Seahawks. Because if you think about the top-level view of a transistor, Here's the W, and here's the L. So you might think, okay, what's really important at the end of the day is this RC time constant? Keep in mind that the sea is that the C that you're driving, right? It's not your your switch, it's the switch that you're driving. So in this picture here, the capacitance that matters is your load, whereas the R is your own resistance. So you're gonna be charging and discharging these capacitors. Let's just imagine that we turn on this switch. Let's actually see that charging and discharging happening. Let's say that this is at 0 v. So this is basically as I've shown over here, this is at 1 v because it's being pulled high. This switch is initially off. So that means that this is charged to 0 v. So initially this is on and this is switches off. Now I'm going to turn this switch on and turn this switch off. So I'll just basically show it like that. So if we look at this circuit, the conducting path is from 1 v through the transistors are on. And it needs to charge up not only this capacitor, but this capacitor. These two capacitors need to get charged up. And when these capacitors charge up to the threshold voltage, then this transistor will turn on and pull the output load. So just heuristically, I can imagine that this node is going to be going from zero towards 1 v, right? With a time constant tau RC. And the output is at 1 v. But it's going to basically remain at 1 v until you hit the threshold voltage over here. Let's call that T1. So T1 is the point at which you hit the threshold voltage. And then once that transistor turns on, it also has some load capacitance, so it's going to discharge to ground not instantaneously, but with the same RC time constant characteristics that we've seen before. Because there is a load capacitance here. Everything is connected to something else. There's nothing just floating. Even if it's not driving anything. There's still parasitic capacitances there. But this time constant could be much faster or slower than the other time constant just depends on how much capacitance is there. Okay? So in this picture, there's two time constants that the characteristic time constant of the circuit and the T1 time constant, which is how long it takes to reach the threshold voltage. It's important to note though those aren't the same thing. The characteristic time constant is, how long does it take to get roughly to 70% of the final value? Right? Now? You might think, here's my physical transistor. How can I make my switching circuit faster? How do I make? Are smaller? Anybody? Yeah, which links would, would help? Sure. How would you make, how small would you make L as smallest possible you would go to L min. Elman is, is basically determined by lithography. In any technology node. When someone sends says this CPU was in a 28 nanometer technology mode node, what they're really saying is the minimum channel length is 28 nm. That's it. You can't go smaller than that. If you go smaller than that, the manufacturer says, I can't guarantee that these devices work. But if as long as you stick to my design rules and don't go below 28 nm, I guarantee you that most of your transistors will work. So that's, that's it. What about w? Can I make, what would I do with W? To make things faster? Yeah, make W larger. But notice that making, So let, let's say this is proportional to basically the L goes down with w. But notice that the capacitance, the capacitance is basically this area, which is W times L, right? And so from here we can see that the factor W cancels out. If the, if your load is made up of the same kind of transistor, then making your transistor bigger is not necessarily going to help. The only thing that can help is you hold your load constant and you make the driving transistor wider. That works. But if you're driving the same size inverter as that You are, right, then it doesn't help this factor of W cancels out. But look, there's a factor of L squared. That's important. So that's why moving to smaller and smaller technology nodes allowed people to run transistors faster and faster. That's how we went from 1 mhz in 1984 to 10 ghz today. Okay? Now, that's the switch model of the transistor. Let's, you know, we like I-V curves. Let's think of our transistor as a resistor. So this is the eye through the transistor, and this is the V through the transistor. Maybe we've said very little about the voltage across the transistor right? Now, if this were a simple resistor, this is I, this is V. The I-V curve would look like this. Okay? For a transistor that is below threshold voltage. The I-V curve also looks like a nice straight line, right? What does it look like? If you're at below threshold voltage? It's a flat line, right? It's dead. No current. If we increase the voltage on the device and turn it on. But we'll see is a family of curves. They all cross the origin. This is v gate one, this is V2, this is v gate three, and so on. Why is the slope increasing? The slope is one over resistance, right? Its conductivity. So why is the conductivity going up? I'll think about that valve and algae right? Higher the gate voltage. Right? The further upward pulling the valve, The bigger the more current that can flow. Basically, the higher the gate voltage is, the more charge we're inducing and the channel. And the more conductive the transistor. Now the other interesting thing about transistors is something that happens. That's really important for amplifiers. So maybe we will say a little bit about that today and the rest will have to be some other time. The question is what happens as we keep increasing the voltage for normal resistor until you melt the resistance, right? Eventually enough current will go through it that'll get so hot. I squared R heating will melt it. For transistors. Something else happens very quickly. What happens is the current saturates. And it doesn't matter what gate voltage you put in. Same thing kinda happens actually the gate voltage will influence more or less how quickly it saturates. So we can say that there's a boundary here between the transistor acting like a on resistance to, acting like a current source. Because remember a flatline over here, which is not on the zero axis, is a constant current. So a transistor somehow magically changes from a resistor to a current source, depending on the voltage that you put on it. We'd like to say that the current saturates. So this is sometimes called saturation. This region has a very esoteric name. It's called the triode region. It's because before transistors we had tubes, right? That's what they're called. They're valves and tubes. And those back in the day. If you look at vacuum tube transistor, a vacuum tube devices, they behave a lot like transistors. And they have these regions sit in a similar way. The physics is a little different. And so this region is called triode region. You might be wondering what happens over here. Well, we never go over here. Okay. Anybody want to guess why we never go there? Yeah. Yeah. If the current, it basically if I apply a voltage and the current flows in the opposite direction than I expect, then that's creating energy, right? So transistor, it can move energy, it can relay energy, but it can't create energy out of nothing. So only voltage sources or current sources and batteries, right? Essentially only batteries live in that region. So what we find is the curve is more or less symmetric. Over here. Again here the current is negative and the voltage is negative. And so it behaves more or less the same. There's mirror symmetric in this region as well. So this is what a real transistor does. And what's important is the model of the transistor in this region. So I'm telling you, I have a current that changes depending on the gate voltage, the current source, but it's not independent. It depends on the value of the gate voltage. How would you model that? Well, this is an independent current source. I'm saying it's not an independent current source, right? It depends on something. What does it depend on? The gate voltage, right? So what do you call a gate dependent current source? So instead of a circle, we draw a diamond, right? And we say that the current depends on VGS. So this is a model of a transistor. We still need that capacitance, just like before. The current through the device depends on the gate voltage. So it's acting like a dependent current source. And this is actually really important. This is how we're going to build amplifiers out of transistors. So for today's lecture though, I don't want to spend too much time on it. We talked a lot about the cmos inverter. And you might be wondering, Jesus, if you haven't taken 61, see, you might be puzzled and just thinking like inverter, who cares? Like, I want to build something more interesting, right? I want to do logic. How do you build a logic gate out of transistors? Will very briefly, you can realize that you can build logic gates by combining devices. So for instance, I'll call this N1, this into, let me pull these out. In one into me, take my output over here. And these are gonna be PMOS is. Now you'll very quickly catch on to the idea. The idea here is, if I put two switches in series. Then to get the ground, both switches need to be on. If we're only one switches on, I'm not going to have a connection to ground. So to produce a zero at the output, I need both switches to be on. So let me make a truth table here. N1, N2 out. So I'm going to say that if inputs, if both inputs come in at 0 v, both transistors are off, right? So there's not gonna be, we don't know what's going to happen yet. If either input is zero. I'm in a similar situation. I don't know what the output is because the conducting path to ground is not there. I can tell you it's not going to be grounded. What I can tell you at this point is if both inputs are one, then both transistors are on. And the output is going to get pulled to ground unless it has to fight the top transistors. But let's assume that there's no fight. Because this is complimentary logic. We're going to let the end mosses determine how we get to ground voltage. And we're going to let the PMOS is determined how to get to VDD. And by making this complimentary and never fighting each other. That's how we got the static current to be zero. Because there's never a case where both switches off the top switches and the bottom switches are never on simultaneously. They don't need to fight each other. They turned on simultaneously. It's not a good thing. Not only we dissipate power, but then the output voltage depends on the ratios of the devices and you don't wanna do that. It's ugly. Alright, so let's just assume that we just take these two transistors and we hook them up to the same inputs. So these are PMOS devices. This is 1 v here. So what can you say about these three cases? In every case? Let's start out here on this row. If N1 is positive, that means this transistor is off, right? Because the threshold voltage is not negative. On the other hand, the second transistor, N2, is at 0 v, which means that this transistor turns on and it pulls the output to one. Okay? Now by symmetry, this, they're just two devices in parallel. This case is also one. I don't need to draw that. And then finally, if both are, if both voltages are zero, both transistors are on and they both pull the output up to VDD now with half the resistance. But in all three cases we can see that the bottom transistors are off and the top path to the ground is not there, right? I shouldn't say the bottom transistors or if at least one bottom transistor is off. And the path to supply as established by the PMOS devices. So this is the logic table for this device. What would you call this device? You almost want to call it an end gate because you need both inputs to be high for the output to transition, right? But instead of n, where you transition to high, we're transitioning to low. So let's call this a NAND gate, right? And maybe give it a symbol like that. You'll see this bubble is very convenient. I just take the symbol of an AND gate. I invert its output, I get a NAND gate. A NAND gate is just as good as an end gate in terms of universal logic. If you want to build a computer, you can use NAND gates and NOR gates and do the same thing. Okay. Any questions? You guys saw a hand go up? Yeah. Which symbol? Yeah. So basically we have NOR gates or gates. We have n gates or NAND gates. And we have basically inverters or just buffers. And you can see that if you put an inverter at the output of every one of these than their equivalent. Right? Now these transistors have a lot of interesting applications. Another interesting application is memory. Let's say I want to build a memory element. I want to build something that remembers if a zero is stored or one is stored. So this circuit, if you think about it, if I put in a zero, I get zero. So what if I take this and connect it back up to here? So this is basically going 0-1 v, right? And then back down to 0 v, and then I connected back into a loop. You might say, well, what if the input had been 1 v? That's also consistent. So which is it, right? Either state is consistent, as long as the input is equal to the output, this circuit can continue to regenerate that state. We call this a bi-stable circuit. It has two stable states. A state where it's storing a zero and a state where it's storing a one. It's exactly what a memory element is, goes around the loop that reminds itself, I'm a 000. Then you tell it no, no, no, you're one. Right? And then it goes around. Loop says I'm the one, I'm a one-on-one and it remembers that it's storing a one. Okay, we'll pick that up next lecture. Thanks everyone.
